Celia is restless, walking around the upper part of the piano room, arranging books and peering through a broken telescope.  Eventually, her stomach growls. Maybe grabbing food at this late hour would ease her restlessness. 

So, she quickly makes her way to the exit, down the small ladder, and delicately climbed and dropped her way down the tall tree. She didn’t care to take her mask with her this time, considering <em>it to be a quick trip to and from the kitchen</em>. Her hood should be fine.

<em>Tiptoe, tiptoe.</em> Celia slips past an array of doors, passing through a pair that swung open almost at her command. Fluorescent lights buzzed on to illuminate the room — a few cooking stations, a round counter, cabinets and sinks along the wall, and two fridges side by side. 

There wasn’t much to eat for now. She knew in the fridge was mostly what was left after dinners or from company budgeting - few snacks. So Celia figured she’d try to make a meal. Some bread, any meat edible enough to fill a small stomach, cheese… <em>It’s too late for a gourmet meal, so this should suffice.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Especially ones such as this, where there is ample free time. Even if he may not make it audible, he appreciated the distraction provided by his raucous coworkers. In the later hours of the night however, there&#39;s no shouting or painful wounds. No need to feel the blood rush to your fingers as you clamp on tight to your weapons. 

Now, there is only silence. The dreadful quiet accompanied by thoughts of everything that was ever lost. Try as he might, his mind cannot help but fill with thoughts of his life prior to Limbus Company, and the painful scenes that led up to it. 

Sinclair&#39;s heart quickens in pace, and he feels his breath catch in his throat. He wouldn&#39;t be falling asleep now, and he&#39;d only feel more miserable trapped in his room. It wouldn&#39;t be much, but a short trip to get some water may be enough to soothe his spirit. 

Keeping his footsteps as quiet as can be, he snakes out of his room and saunters towards the kitchen.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She could add a side, or try and squeeze some of the fruits they were lucky enough to afford recently to make some juice cocktail, leaving enough for those who needed a quick refresher. <em>Where did they even get these?</em>

She pulled out a pan. Turned on one of the eyes of the stove on a rusting kitchenette, pretended it was just another performance. Celia wasn’t an excellent cook— being comatose for years isn’t exactly helpful with developing life skills, but some of her coworkers were kind enough to spare some evenings letting her assist in the kitchen. <em>Ishmael says to butter the pan, butter my bread, and to butter my senses.</em> 

Celia sighed. She followed the advice to a T, arranging the elements of her sandwich and preparing to toast it. She wasn’t even paying attention to any external sounds any longer - <em>there shouldn’t be any,</em> as she recollected to herself. 

That also meant she was blissfully unaware of Sinclair soon coming to the kitchen to join the midnight escapade.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Most would be sleeping by now, and those that may be awake are probably busying themselves with other things. Maybe Rodya? It&#39;s no secret that she likes her food. If anything, this eased Sinclair a little. Being able to talk to someone would kill some time till he felt tired enough to sleep. 

Gingerly, he opens the door, keeping himself sotto voce &quot;Rodya..? Are you still up at th-&quot; Sinclair cuts himself short as he notices a distinctly not Rodya-Shaped figure in the place he assumed her to be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They made eye contact for a brief second. Although her hood concealed the clarity of her face through shadow, Celia still didn’t have a mask on and it was clear that that was just her face. 

<em>Oh no.</em>

Her right hand grabbed the sizzling pan to take it off the stove, holding it away from her body. Celia then used her left hand to swipe a knife off the counter and quickly point it towards Sinclair, perpendicular to her body. She made sure that her face wasn’t seen further, only the side of her white and red-striped hooded cloak. 

“…” 

Not the optimal response, but we’ll take it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;C-Celia! It&#39;s just me. It&#39;s just me, Sinclair. Lets... uh... not do anything hasty. Right?&quot; 

Sinclair nervously clamped his teeth down on his tongue. It&#39;s not to say that Sinclair hated any of his coworkers, but he was certainly a lot closer to some compared to the others. Celia fell in the latter case. Although a calm demeanor was a nice change of pace, it also carried a somewhat cold presence.

 Not to mention her mask. It was kind of creepy, and reminded him of the dolls that accompanied the Doomsday Calendar abnormality, whose E.G.O he was all too familiar with as well. Suddenly it clicked for Sinclair. She wasn&#39;t wearing her mask. For what felt like the shortest of moments, their eyes locked. Although it was impossible for him to make out the distinct features, he was certain that it had happened. 

Regardless, he was certain that the last thing either party would want would to be incurring the ire of Vergilius for causing a commotion in the small hours of the day. He was <em>almost</em> certain he could get out of this situation without needing any touchups from Dante later.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“…” 

<em>He didn’t see anything, right? No, of course not.</em>

That mattered to her. Only those she really trusted could look at her, and Sinclair was definitely not one of them. Nothing against him - in fact, Celia found him to be rather pleasant in comparison to most others. 

However, that was still not a metric of trust. Quietly, she kept her head low while trying to resume her cooking. Her left hand now started pulling the fabric to shield whatever could be seen of her face without completely obstructing her view. 

“…”

“…Sorry.”

With a voice as soft and sweet as a cat’s meow, Celia murmured her sheepish apology while trying to grab a plate and flip her late night meal onto it. That apology, at least, was one of the first few words Celia’s ever directly spoken to Sinclair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even though it felt like at this point it was a fleeting afterthought, after dying countless times over, he could never truly be comfortable with the idea of the deep cold of nothingness, only to have himself torn from it just as suddenly. 

Pushing aside those thoughts, he was able to focus better on his surroundings. It seems like Celia had also come searching for something, although in this case sought a meal as opposed to the quick drink of water Sinclair was planning to get. It wasn&#39;t hard to grasp that the last thing Celia wanted would be Sinclair looking at her face. He awkwardly shuffled around the kitchen, trying to keep his head in the other direction of her, fumbling with a paper cup to fill with water.

As he sipped the cool water he found himself wanting to seize the opprotunity of conversation. Even if this wasn&#39;t his first choice of company, it definitely wasn&#39;t his last. And besides, he may as well kill two birds with one stone and try to get to know his fellow Sinner better. 

&quot;I-It&#39;s fine. Um... couldn&#39;t sleep either, yeah?&quot;

As Sinclair spoke, he kept his gaze fixed to the floor, as if he was suddenly concerned with the color of his shoes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia’s not much of a speaker. In fact, it’s known that she’s one of the most silent sinners, not even speaking when spoken to. To hear her voice is a miracle, let alone have her directly face you. 

Taking the toasted sandwich sitting on a half-bent plate in one hand, Celia sat on one of the stools that was near the counters lining a central island. She tried to speak.

“Yeah. The night is always tough.”

She&#39;s gone now. The whistles he hears aren&#39;t real. There&#39;s no cackling in the wind, and there&#39;s no figures in the shadows. Kromer should be a distant memory. But her grip was always so tight on his mind.

&quot;...Just things that are in the past now. Not worth fussing over, but I still find myself thinking about it.&quot;

Such a simply poised answer. Truthfully, if anything <em>was</em> bothering her, she doesn’t care to give it enough attention to be figured out. It could be the lack of memory, the nagging of others to speak, or the feeling that she doesn’t wish to be in her room for long. 

Celia shrugged a little. If she was gonna have a substantial interaction — now that she’s been thrust into it — she might as well speak a little more. Out of everyone, Sinclair seemed to be least likely to brag about his achievement of hearing more than 10 words from Celia.

Sinclair wasn&#39;t entirely sure how to interpret her response, but given how little he knows of Celia it&#39;d be best to take her answers at face value. The topic of the conversation was a bit gloom, and felt as if it was dangerously close to open up old wounds, so Sinclair took his best efforts to steer away from it now that seemingly she was engaged in their little chat.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you could cook.&quot;

Right as the words came out of his mouth, internally Sinclair felt the desire to slump down on the floor.

“I didn’t at first. Not much one can do in their sleep.” 

She tilted her head up, vaguely facing Sinclair’s direction while still being careful to hide her face. 

“Meursault teaches me now.”

The implications of her statement weigh heavy on her. She admitted she didn’t know much, but not the reason why — this would be the first time she’s mentioned it so casually, as if recalling a simple memory.

Sinclair found that Celia seemed to lack... personality, for lack of a better descriptor. She seemed keen on answers that would satisfy whatever prompt given to her, and nothing more. It&#39;s no wonder she is able to get along with the most esoteric sinner among them. 

&quot;I&#39;ll probably look into it as a personal endeavor... I&#39;m sure Meursault&#39;s busy anyway...&quot;

It felt odd to try and hold a conversation with someone he couldn&#39;t look at. From a young age his parents had drilled into his head that there was a proper way for everything. A proper way to eat. A proper way to walk. A proper way to speak. It felt alien to actively avoid eye contact.

&quot;How has work been treating you? There&#39;s nothing too troublesome, I hope?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His persistence on talking was almost frustrating. Normally, she doesn’t speak this much outside of routine counseling sessions. However, this might be a one-off moment, so she might as well give as much thought as her brain could muster. 

“Do you need to ask a question like that? It’d be the same for you… but…” 

She gulped. <em>Would it?</em> Celia didn’t ever have to really ponder how she felt about anything — it all fell under if she remembered or if she didn’t. But right now, she’s thinking somewhat deeper.

“…I think I enjoy it. It’s — simple, I don’t need to remember anything.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair catches himself from rambling further. While it is a bit embarrassing that it feels like he&#39;s dragging this conversation by the heels, he was very grateful as well to her for humoring him, even if it was just a matter of circumstance. 

But there was one thing above all else Sinclair was curious about involving Celia. He wanted to know why she had gotten so worked up about the idea of Sinclair seeing her without the mask on. Granted, he was no stranger to being threatened with his life, but he hadn&#39;t expected it from her. 

He bit down on his tongue again with trepidation, contemplating if he should even pop the question, let alone the fact that she would give him an answer.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Something about how she spoke with such a monotone voice felt nearly unsettling, like speaking to a shell of a person. Celia ate between her comments, staring down at her small meal and examining what she liked or disliked.

<em>The cheese is not melted enough, but the ham is hot. Did I heat the pan too fast? Maybe I should use mayo instead of butter to coat the bread….</em> 

Pondering such deep thoughts about a mundane food, Celia twirled the plate with one finger idly. Her mind ran surprisingly blank, as if no thoughts existed there at all. What a difficult partner to converse with.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair felt like he was walking on thin ice on already uncertain ground. He was hoping that he could inch towards the question, rather than hitting her with it face on.

She choked up on her words again. Perhaps it was bringing up things her brain didn’t quite yet want to remember, or just her attempt at forming a response he’d understand. 

“Uhm, I.”

She bites her tongue. <em>How to explain this,</em> the thought runs through her head over and over. Does she even know what she’s trying to say? 

“I didn’t think anyone else was awake. This would be 5 minutes, in and out.” 

Well, that answered one piece of it. She rubbed her nose with her knuckle, unsure of even why she was so concerned about Sinclair seeing her face — it’s not like she’s disfigured, or insecure about her looks. Perhaps it was the principle. But she wasn’t gonna say that.

&quot;Yeah... it&#39;s empty. Uncomfortably so. Nor do I like what it reveals about me...&quot;

Sinclair says the last part with some uncharacteristic venom to it. Having even his own room remind him about everything he wishes to forget is only a source of displeasure for him. 

&quot;But I guess I can&#39;t really get away from that. How about your room? Is it to your liking at least?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“It’s… large. And familiar.” 

She clasped her hands together, holding them near her chest. Celia pondered to herself — well, she knew an extent of what he had gone through, but not enough to understand the contents of his room … or what little she saw of it. 

“I find it calming until the place shakes, and the sky crumbles —“

The thought made Celia shiver. 

“— uhm. Would you like to see?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair had to do a double take. She was inviting him in?  This was an unexpected development. 

&quot;O-oh... alright. I&#39;ll come.&quot;

He wasn&#39;t sure entirely what to expect. Sinclair seldom entered the expansion of Mephistopheles, let alone lingered around long enough to gaze at the rooms of the Sinners that were lined up within it. 

Still, the idea was rather interesting, and Sinclair took it as an indication that he hadn&#39;t gotten on her bad side despite the various missteps he may have taken since the start of their interaction, which he was grateful for.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was no way he could truly get on her bad side — but Celia offered the kind gesture on the front of it helping Sinclair, and possibly easing his curiosity.

She nodded. Making her way towards the kitchen’s exit, the doors slid open with a careful whirring to let Celia pass. The cloth of her cloak dragged behind her like the train of a dress, giving her a larger appearance than her short stature could attribute. 

She stayed silent, just walking towards her half of the bus. Her door wasn’t too far, being #16 meant only a few others came before. 

Before she opened the door, she turned back to Sinclair — just to see if he was still nearby.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair kept his voice down to a whisper, so as to avoid disturbing those who may be sleeping. It was rare for the bus to be this quiet, which only added to list of odd things that were occurring tonight for him.  

&quot;Thank you for inviting me...&quot;

Sinclair mumbled out his brief thanks. He found himself apologizing and thanking a lot tonight, but courtesy never hurt.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No need to answer.

She opened the door slowly, and the environment seemed to unfold itself. A room with a shallow pool of water at the bottom, and lots of greenery in different spots. Upon looking up, the ceiling felt unreachable -- this was definitely the tallest room in all of Mephistopheles, and it seemed to be a miracle that such an expansive space could exist.

At the bottom of the central tree was a piano enwrapped in the tree&#39;s roots, as if having forcibly grown and split the tree into the two stalks that stretched to the roof. Celia walked forward, carefully treading across the shallow water. Two doors were on the left and right of the tree, one of them ajar and leaking light into the room from what appeared to be a library.

Celia took a small scroll off the top of the piano&#39;s keys, storing it within her sleeve.

&quot;This is it.&quot;

This <em>wasn&#39;t</em> it, as there were many rooms to explore, but Celia wasn&#39;t going to elaborate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As he crossed the water, he grabbed the tail end of his coat to prevent it from getting wet. Still, it was nice. While the tree somewhat reminded him of his room, that is likely where the similarities end. It was a far-cry from the half lit and bare room he occupied.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful here... hard to believe it&#39;s not a scene torn from a storybook.&quot;

 Behind the piano was a small bookshelf of her items and various books she&#39;s collected, but tucked between them was her mask. Carefully, pushing two separate pieces closer together, she put on the mask to conceal her face. Celia turned back to Sinclair.

&quot;Mm. Thanks...&quot;

Sinclair cuts himself off, but continues to eye the piano. 

As far as he knew, the contents of the room were somehow related to ones E.G.O, as he had often seen the branch of knowledge lain about within the division of light and darkness in his room. 

 He personally could not fathom most of it, but what he did know was that even looking at the piano caused his heart to ache a little.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A face popped up in her mind, but it was hazy. The memory of someone important, but not so much they are clear in her mind… Celia’s mind clouded while trying to push away the recollection. Failing to remember who or what brought the instrument to her, Celia’s voice cracked. She swallowed, turning away and quietly hoisting herself up onto one of the branches of the left side of the tree. 

To get to a decent place to rest that <em>wasn’t</em> in the overgrown and off-access basement, they’d have to climb. So, Celia held part of the tree and looked down at Sinclair.

“Uhm…

She took his hand in hers, pulling him up with her. 

“Please rest.” 

It was surprising to think past the thick greenery was yet another floor. A door was binded shut by thorned vines, while another was open into a small room with a telescope - and what appeared to function as Celia’s bedroom.

Various framed photographs were on the walls and doorframes, depicting an obscured figure and a very young Celia. There were also sheets of music plastered on the walls, some complete and others nearing blank. 

Celia walked into the open door, moving the broken telescope and pushing a pile of books besides a bookshelf. 

“…hm…”

As if remembering a puzzle, a few of the lampposts between shelves were turned off, before one of the bookshelves sank into the wall to reveal a small sage cushion to function as a makeshift bed.

Surprisingly, even she was somewhat amazed that many of the secrets were kept the same — Celia almost felt filled with a sense of wonder, desiring to see what else was the same. 

In her quiet mess of sheepishness, Celia let out a soft laugh. Was she entertained by this? <em>Certainly.</em>

“Ah. Sorry,” she quietly murmured while quickly moving to pick up the books that were strewn about the floor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia carefully placed it back in the book’s pages before she could ruminate on it. She turned back to Sinclair and gave a polite bow as a thanks. 

Quietly, she sat upon a bed that could only fit her, adorned with simple sheets and a small cat plush with a seamed mouth.

It was as if Celia didn’t want to answer. It was no doubt that the little girl in the photos <em>was</em> her, in her happy and norml childhood. 

She could only really nod, choosing not to gaze near the photographs. Her eyes fixated past the railing by the edge of the room, peering into a void she could not dream of filling. 

Whoever that person was, must’ve been important — but forgotten, or erased. But it wasn’t anything Celia could really figure out right now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And above all else, for once he was atop the tree, instead of cowering in its shadow.

&quot;You&#39;re doing good... you&#39;re stronger than you think... I&#39;m proud...&quot;

She felt relieved that now, she could drift to sleep. A small escapade wasn’t harmful — in fact, this one was productive. Celia slowly removed her mask, placing it next to her pillow and laying down.

As his eyes cracked open and he stretched the stiffness out of his body, Sinclair recalled the memories of the night before. 

<em>...</em>

Sinclair admonished himself for still thinking this way. But he couldn&#39;t help but pray every night when he opened his eyes, that he would be greeted by the ceiling of the room he slept in all his life. 

Maybe tomorrow he would wake up from this nightmare. 

He was unsure of what time it was, but it would be better to arise now than risk being late. Sinclair went to go rouse his companion from her slumber, but was stunned. 

Celia had forgone her mask while she was sleeping, and for the first time ever, he finally was able to see the face of his companion. But there was nothing wrong with her face.

Slowly, she simply took the mask and put it over her face. Celia sat up and moved off of the bed, making it without a sound. 

Beneath the mask, though, her face was red. The only other person to have seen Celia’s full face was Rodya, who wiped her tears away when Celia began crying from fear after experiencing her first death. Now, Sinclair was the second.

Did Celia say anything? No, she couldn’t really make a reaponse. All she did was simply act like it didn’t happen, letting the embarrassment and anxiety stew deep within her. <em>He wouldn’t tell anyone, right…?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slowly Sinclair peeled his hands off his head, and awkwardly faced her again, trying to speak without sounding like he was mere moments from keeling over.

&quot;H-Hey... um... C-Celia...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Hm?”

What, was he going to make some comment about how empty her expression was? Or try and rationalize what happened, apologizing profusely?

Truthfully, she intended to be forgiving. If it were someone like Heathcliff or Ryoshu, she wouldn’t have hesitated to knock them to the ground and throw them on top of the piano. Even if it got damaged, it’d repair itself regardless. 

But this was Sinclair. She was willing to listen, especially as he was kind enough to try and save face in the moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She quietly took his hand in both of hers, holding it as delicately as possible. She intertwined their fingers, gently squeezed his palm — all trying to be very gentle.

Then, she bowed down a little and brushed the top of Sinclair’s hand against her mask. It was like an attempt to offer a polite kiss to the hand, but all that could be felt was the coldness of the porcelain mask.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia ducked her head down and put on her hood, taking Sinclair&#39;s hand to halfway-drag him out of the room. She lowered herself onto a sturdy branch. After finding solid footing, she lifted her arms up as if to catch Sinclair in the case he were to fall.

&quot;The way down&#39;s a lot easier,&quot; she clarified quietly. &quot;But I got you.&quot;

What a ... kind gesture. 

Part of her wished it was early enough that no one was awake -- not that there&#39;d be much questioning, but she perhaps felt somewhat sheepish about the prospect of someone noticing Sinclair leaving Celia&#39;s room. 

Their chances right now <em>should</em> be slim.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair had to hold his breath during the descent. She was right, it was a lot easier to go down than up, but every time he had to look for his next foothold, he would catch sight of the daunting fall should he slip. It made his hairs stand on end just thinking about the fall should he lose balance.

The idea of getting caught leaving Celia’s room was a bit awkward. There would be no doubt about it that some Sinners would take much joy in the opportunity to poke fun. 

But even if they should get caught, he could tolerate the shame for the sake of this moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair stopped when Celia grabbed onto him. It&#39;s strange how the moment her fingers locked around his wrists, he was as stiff as a statue. It&#39;s not that her grip was particularly powerful in this moment, but it seemed to hold Sinclair so strongly.

&quot;I-Is something wrong, Celia?&quot;

Sinclair felt his cheeks grow a little rosy, but also was confused as to what she held him up for. Maybe she forgot something at the top of the tree? Or was it something else?

With her head turned down, she pulled the other sinner in for a brief embrace. It was careful and delicate, but deeply heartfelt.

It was not like there was an absence of hugs or affection in Sinclair&#39;s life, but it felt like it had been so long since he last experienced it, that it was purifying.

 For so long now Sinclair was horrified, that he had become something unworthy of loving. He was a coward. So afraid, again and again. Too afraid to face himself, to accept the evil within. Too afraid of the times his sense of self was dominated by an E.G.O. Too afraid of the selves that lied within the mirror. Too afraid of blood on his hands.  

Sinclair felt powerless as tears dribbled down his face. It was cleansing. Every tear containing vitriol and hatred, resentment and rage that he wished to keep away from the world. 

But here it was safe. The tears would never be seen again once they land within the shallow pool.

And now, she was having to go back to her usual quiet self, but she was longing for that connection to remain. Perhaps she&#39;d invite him another night, playing some of the songs she&#39;s found the sheets to. Maybe she&#39;ll sit under the tree in <em>his</em> room, reading a book and hearing his story. 

Celia didn&#39;t quite remember what story she could tell him -- perhaps it would be of her dream, but it&#39;d reveal too much.

His voice was small when he spoke, still trembling. He ought to head back to his room and freshen up before the morning round-up. It&#39;d likely be another busy day of whatever they would need to fight, but at this point Sinclair was more than used to this line of work.

He slipped out of the room, moving with relative haste to return to the half of the bus his room presided in. As soon as he opened the door he was greeted by the familiar sights. 

The divide of darkness and light, the floor of dead leaves that never cleared no matter how many times he cleaned it, the lone seat that remained in the darkness. And of course, the shadow of the tree that didn&#39;t exist physically.

She waded into the library, sitting at the desk and staring at the massive book that held endless notes of the world outside -- from simple things like how trees grow, to complex things such as the intricacies of a fixer&#39;s life.

The page she was fixated on, it only had images of brains and skulls, and words she couldn&#39;t quite read. She felt scared to ask anyone else more qualified, but knew that the pages were important. 

From a drawer were withdrawn the few things she needed to get ready. Exchanging the cloak and shirt for pieces of her uniform, placing the stopwatch in that drawer to take out her ID tag. 

&quot;...&quot;

When she felt she was ready, she put the mask back on and waded her way to the front of the bus, sitting in the back as she was designated to. Turns out Celia was one of the first, only being met with the cold gazes of Faust and her half-asleep lackey.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As much as the silence irked him, it was one of the few moments of peace he would be experiencing today. The only sound accompanying his footsteps as he meandered around his room was the crunching of dead leaves when he entered the dimmer half of his room. 

Once he finally had his hair settled and his attire as proper as it could look, he readjusted the clip of his ID card. The Sinclair in that photo looked like it was from lifetimes ago. 

With Vogel in hand, Sinclair was one foot out the door before he looked back one more time.

<em>And what should happen, if the snake ever satisfies its hunger?</em>

A few of the more duteous sinners were already here. Meursault, Faust, Outis, and Ishmael of his original companions had already assumed their seats. While in the extended row he identified a few faces as well. He wasn&#39;t quite well acquainted with the whole of them, but they were tolerable at worst, which is the best Sinclair could hope for. 

It was easy enough to make out Celia. Her mask did not exactly make her inconspicuous. He looked at her for a moment or two, before turning his head back towards the front of the bus, feeling bashful.

He took his seat, although the ones that occupied the same row were still absent presently.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While not exchanging a look back, her arms somewhat tightened around Recital as he soon turned back. Her stomach churned.

 She watched the others file in, reacting as usual to their morning wake-up routine. A tall one grumbles some swears, an even taller one slouches behind with no word and drops in his seat. The lesser knight strutted in jubilantly, lance in hand to sit upon her rightful place and take in a new adventure. A princess dashes forth with her jade-eyed prince, sitting in their spots and resuming their morning chatter past unwilling ears while downing the remains of breakfast.

Celia realized she didn’t eat breakfast — but she also lacked an appetite. Perhaps it would come through the day.

As the rest of the sinners made their way to their seats, Celia kept her head up to listen to any instruction. A makeshift role call later, off the bus went. 

This time, while LCC prepared for the next Golden Bough, a few fixers of a renowned legal office needed assistance in handling their distorted boss. They greeted Limbus Company with grace, one of them seeming to glance at a few of the sinners between statements.

The operation was (somewhat) smooth. Although said distortion was self-contained within the bowels of its own office, what proved to be an issue was when said office became an obstacle itself. Celia watched indifferently as she and her coworkers passed — they revived within moments, too. In the end, a hefty reward and likely some social credit was due for the newer firm. 

One dinner later, with Celia mysteriously eating with the mask on (in truth, she just lifted it to quickly take bites), the sinners were all back on the bus with more knowledge and (likely) new fears. Of either Abno-parasitism, <em>partial</em> distortion, or simply anything with too many eyes. 

At the end of the day, Celia trudged back to her seat — her gaze was fixed outside the window. <em>Finally… another day done.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Not my day today...</em>

He found himself thinking that often. But to his merit there was some truth to his words. While the operation was ultimately successful, it was not without great toll to Sinclair himself. 

To Sinclair&#39;s credit, he could get things done when the situation hinged on it, but when he was asked to affix a mirror ID onto himself, he was contemplating just gutting himself. Ironically, the mirror self which he loathed most actively, was easily one of if not, <em>the</em> strongest in Dante&#39;s current repertoire. 

It was not enough to have his thoughts and actions pervaded by things he&#39;d rather suppress, but he unfortunately found himself corroding a multitude of times. Even now he can feel the judgmental stares of a few of the Sinners. Especially those that reside in the extension of the bus, who were less familiar with this particular ID.

<em>So much for making friends... No one wants to make nice with a person that bisected them...</em>

At least they helped people, was the sole reprieve Sinclair had. Even if he had to suffer for the sake of it.

At the very least, the day was over. He wouldn&#39;t have to worry about today, because soon enough it would be yesterday.

But still, one thought stuck to Sinclair&#39;s head.

But it also had drawbacks.

Ever since Faust made those extensions and sent out a new wave of contracts, it’s like having to go through orientation all over. These new employees were more unhinged, eccentric — Celia among the bunch was no exception. 

Celia was used to how things ran, even being the easiest one to extract IDs of out of the bunch — it seemed she was full of endless potential, able to shift in any way and make any melody work. 

However, with such potential came that she was frail. In the heat of the moment, she hadn’t noticed Sinclair corroding and heading straight for her — normally, Rodya would’ve taken most of the hit, or she would at least make it out only somewhat injured, but the second Celia could try and warn others, it was already time to rewind. 

Sinclair had killed her — not an unfamiliar occurrence, but the way it made her think had definitely changed. 

As she sat and replayed that moment, she could feel a sense of sorrow. Neither of them wanted to be in that position, it was just… an accident. Besides — whatever they were dealing with, it was tanking everyone’s sanity, even Celia’s.

It may just be his nerves on edge, but it felt just about every single eye in the room was on him. Even if for a fraction of a second, there was the icy cold waves of contempt, and disappointment. Some definitely made it more obvious than others that they were unfortunate victims of his mental instability. 

It was an unfortunate curse that Sinclair had gotten skilled at scanning the emotions out of people. Even those who did their best to hide it, he could see a look of concern or fear in their eyes. 

<em>Was it that bad today?</em>

Sinclair heard it was an arduous battle, and in heated conflict he was quicker to lose himself, more like a rabid beast wearing human flesh than a person. 

He spared himself from the desire to make small talk, isolating himself away from the crowd till he was dismissed. 

He hadn&#39;t much of an appetite tonight, but he figured it&#39;d still have been best to eat something, if only to have something to fuel his body tomorrow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Soon, they’d say that the nightly break has begun, and everyone would scurry off to do their usual routines. 

As she departed, she turned her gaze back to Sinclair. Another uncomfortable feeling filled her stomach — but she shoved it down, letting herself make that silent escape. 

It seems like not long after, the sinners were dismissed. She got passed by a few bodies, occasionally stopping to pat her on the head and remark about her disappearance. It was normal. She walked past the double doors of the kitchen — no need to pay mind to it today — and simply slipped away into her room. 

She kept thinking about those moments in her head. The way her heart stopped, the worry not only for her own life anymore— but Sinclair’s as well, and even wondering how she wasn’t fast enough this time. 

Opening the door and seeing the door on the right ajar, she stepped through it. As expected, the room was like she left it. The candelabra glowing golden, the foggy windows, and the painting leading to the basement. 

… She’s… never been able to walk into there before. Celia carefully treaded the stairs fore reaching the bottom, into the basement overgrown with thorny vines and a dense thicket.

<em>Does this mean i…</em> 

She sat down at the piano in the center of the room. It was thickly wrapped in the vines, leaving only the keys exposed. 

“…”

Celia wanted to escape, but she knew she was unable to.
<em>No, I don’t want to do this.</em>

Her guilt and her dread played over and over as she stared at the thorns. Was it offering the solution to her? Who knows.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>I’m just imagining it… No… sh-she’s not there. And it wasn’t your…</em>

<em>Stop thinking.</em>

<em>Stop.</em>

Sinclair’s feelings reached a fever pitch, and he stormed out his room. Water would clear his mind. It was a simple remedy. Fire extinguished by water.

Standing in the kitchen, sipping absently from a paper cup in order to clear his head. Sinclair remembered how a similar situation, albeit one less stressful, led him to his chance encounter with Celia.

Celia was in the basement, then. Surrendering herself to the task at hand, she played the thorn-covered piano. As she continued, vines slowly unwrapped and water began to pour onto the ground. She didn’t notice the door being opened, or the new presence. 

All that mattered to her was clearing up the basement, seeing what it would do and what it meant — an important moment… <em>did something important happen recently?</em>

It was hard to focus though, as his mind was muddled. Resonating so strongly with an ID can mean that it’s thoughts may persist for a good while after. That Sinclair was furious. It wanted nothing more than to tear off its own flesh and smash everything that stood in his way.

Celia’s heart ached. She looked at the left side of the room - more stairs, but the end of them looked to be shrouded in darkness still. If this was a sign she was slowly changing, <em>It’s not a very good one,</em> she could only think.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, September 20, 2023 4:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The music stopped, and Sinclair was left thinking if he should say something. It&#39;s not like she was going to remain oblivious of his presence forever, but at the same time it may be best to let her think for this moment.

&quot;Celia.&quot;

Enough to make himself known, and controlled enough that he would not say words that weren&#39;t his.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia stood up, slowly walking towards Sinclair. In her heart, she debated if she wanted to tell him the truth. The fact he asked meant he cared, but part of Celia wanted to hide it.

However, she’d be haunted by that choice. 

“…”

She gulps. 

“I was killed a few times — but it’s normal. I don’t mind.” 

Said quietly and politely, Celia nodded to herself. That was enough said, her own thoughts lacked enough substance to be added.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair felt like his soul was about to leave his body. Now, he was no stranger to the shame that followed the discovery of what he did, but the fact that he had done it multiple times to her? He felt despicable. 

&quot;No.. um. I-It isn&#39;t normal... don&#39;t say that... d-don&#39;t justify it...&quot;

Sinclair&#39;s voice trembled, he felt dizzy and sick.

&quot;I um... when I did that I wasn&#39;t myself... o-or well, it was me. But not the me you know, if that makes sense... e-even if... it looked like me....&quot;

Sinclair felt like a fool trying to speak, he&#39;s sure Celia is already well aware of the functions of the mirror, someone so full of potential like herself. 

His face was running hot with shame, and he wanted to just run away from the whole situation.

“It’s okay. I understand.” 

She’s talking more now, a sign she was getting comfortable. 

“I…”

She wasn’t going to say she was worried. No way she’d let him in on that. She’s worked here for what, a few months? By now, Celia knew at least the basics of how things worked, she knew that the Sinclair who killed her wasn’t the one she was speaking to now, that she grew close to, that she started to…

Truth be told, the last thing Sinclair desired was to be alone right now, but if she needed her space he was the last person to deny her.

He nodded weakly in return. 

“If… you insist.” 

Sinclair’s mind was a little fuzzy still, but he never recalled anyone being more forgiving of what he had done than now.

He kept his eyes low to the ground, still abashed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her pain may not be as prominent, but she understood his desires. She wished to find something, <em>someone,</em> but it was impossible for her to realize who it was.

“I think you’re already very kind,” she said to him.

Celia had no choice but to hug him back, holding the back of his head with her hand. <em>Who knew that such small words could make such a reaction.</em>

She buried her face into his shoulder, although all that could really be felt was just the coldness of her mask — the force was enough to really show the intent. 

Caring like this was an unfamiliar feeling. It hadn’t been experienced in a long time, but she no longer could picture who or what she was caring for. Living with only half of her memories, everything redacted meant over time, nothing made sense.

Even if Sinclair was a stranger to these feelings, he was not opposed to them. It anchored him to the world again, it reminded him that he was alive. That he was not the evil he repressed. He was not vehement rage and prejudice. They may be parts of him. They might be things he shunned and hid away, but they did not define him.

Everyone had something to hide, things they wished to bury and cover in dirt. And that was okay. That did not make him a monster, it made him a person.

Then, Celia motioned for Sinclair to either sit beside her or on top of the piano -- much like she did when she was in the dream, passing by the hours.

Painful, she wanted to finish, but part of her felt it was worth it. Something in Celia felt that she was making the right choice in getting closer to Sinclair -- he willingly went back to her, seeking her comfort. 

Celia&#39;s hands tightened on the mask. She split it into two, keeping the upper half, and cast the bottom half on top of the white piano, to wait until she put the pieces together.

When she turned back, a faint smile was on her face.

She followed his gaze -- and as Sinclair placed his gloves down, Celia&#39;s expression turned to one of surprise. 

&quot;A-Ah. Don&#39;t worry, the mask can be put back together... the cracks are a guide.&quot;

Celia gently took Sinclair&#39;s hand again, knowing how much he didn&#39;t enjoy having his hands exposed. <em>It&#39;s nice that we can be open with eachother. . .</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Where’s that book…</em>

Ah. Right where she left it. Celia stood on top of a pile of books, grabbing one that had a cover of a tree etched into it. 

When getting it, she hopped off of the pile and walked back into the Piano room. The closed book was placed on the stand, and Celia moved back into place.

Getting lost in thought, Celia nearly forgot to flip to the last page, quickly doing so before starting to play with her free hand.

Did she have feelings? Was that it? She could ask someone for advice, <em>but… that’d reveal everything, wouldn’t it?</em>

Tears welled up in Celia’s eyes as they finished playing together — she tried her best to blink them away. Even if she didn’t remember who that person was, it hurt her to think about anyone she once loved dearly no longer being able to share memories with her. 

…but this love she felt now, wasn’t quite like what she once had. It’s different, refreshing. Like a summer breeze, or a spring rain.

It was one she could never really let go of, even if who that love was attached to dissipated. 

Celia looked up, carefully placing the sheets back, then looked at Sinclair while holding the book to her chest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair mustered up every ounce of courage, every tiny scrap of strength and confidence, and spoke.

&quot;I know... until recently we were almost perfect strangers. But...&quot;

&quot;I want to run my fingers through your hair, and tell you everything. I want to see your face again. I want to play music with you, hear you laugh, I want you to hold me close when I am weak, and I want to be there for you just the same.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I need you, Celia. I need you in a strange way that I cannot explain to myself yet, and I don’t want to. Your presence is calming and comforting. I… I appreciate dearly that you comforted me that night...”

&quot;But, it&#39;s different now. I can face my own problems. I am me... and you are you. It has all become clear to me now. I also learned that I really do need you. It&#39;s not because I need you as a sanctuary for my problems.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I need you because I truly love you.&quot;

Sinclair said everything he withheld. Leaving his heart on the table for her.

Most people do not have the audacity to say the things they leave unsaid, but Sinclair has found time and time again, he is not most people.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Getting the words out was harder than she wanted to admit. But, she couldn’t just leave him without an answer. Especially not after he poured his entire heart out, and after all the beautiful moments they had together.

At that moment, she spoke without even thinking… letting be known what her heart desires.

Celia paused. 

She had something she wanted to do, but couldn’t quite bring herself to do it yet. 

<em>Can I…? Would he…?</em> 

Well, part of her wanted to see his reaction. So, she leaned in and applied the smallest kiss to his cheek. It was less her <em>actually</em> kissing, and more of Celia simply pushing her lips into Sinclair’s skin. 

Right after came some words of reassurance.

“Don’t… feel bad about today, okay? Things happen. Now we’re here.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair wasn&#39;t one well versed in romance, but he had heard from others. Rodya had told him before that a kiss between lovers is different than a kiss from family. While he wasn&#39;t sure what it meant at the time, now he understood there was wisdom to what she said.

As his face turned a deep red, he forced himself to look directly into her eyes, even if he was currently feeling timid.

&quot;Thank you... I really don&#39;t have any other words.... but thank you...for finding in your heart to love me, even when there is something so shameful beneath the surface...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Is that what you think of yourself…?” 

The question was simply poised. She saw nothing shameful, just someone hurting. Someone who’s suffered a lot. That was very much worth caring for, especially given how each meeting they had seemed to have Sinclair on the verge of breaking down. 

Celia asked Iris to catch her up on what she had missed once, having the knight easily recount the stories Faust explained to her in thorough detail. 

From the bug soldiers to the freezing castle, even up to the fight with Kromer and the tragedies within K Corp. itself, Celia knew a lot of the sinners had deep sorrow, and Sinclair’s burrowed deep within him. 

Part of Celia wanted to make a comment about how he felt so strongly for someone who barely even remembers who she is — although such a statement was half-true, as she was merely trying to define it as she went on. 

To Celia, she didn’t understand how he felt about himself — nor did she want to try.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair was still a little flustered, but he wanted to stay with her for a while longer, and enjoy this moment while it was still fresh.

In his own eyes, Sinclair saw Celia as someone who had lost their place in the world. But that&#39;s alright. 

Everyone is looking for something, somehow, someway. So what made her any different?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Admitting that she wanted him to stay with her made her heart pound. <em>Ach, there’s no guides on this…</em> Just going along with what your heart wants. 

Celia stood from the piano and stretched, staring up at the wall between the trees. 

The normally dull center pendant glowed a bright cyan, likely signaling she was… happier than normal. Celia’s never seen that before, but she smiled up at it. As the room shifted to reflect her lighter mood, it was like the sun was shining down after a brief rain. 

She picked up the book again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“…”

Then, she fully took off the fragment that remained over her eye, placing it by the bottom half and pushing the sides together - they slowly formed a whole, leaving the crack that never ceased to exist. 

When she turned back, her face was exposed. All of it. Even if most was visible, something was different about seeing her entire expression, appearing nearly half-asleep. 

It was … cute.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia walked to the bark of the tree, trying to get herself sturdy. Her foot touched a tile right behind the piano, shifting the center of the floor and rotating it until a portion of it raised.

<em>A platform? Ah… must make climbing easier.</em> 

“…This room… keeps surprising me.” 

Celia suddenly felt the urge to withhold this discovery from any new visitors. Just to have them climb. 

“Hmmm….”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair was filled with childlike wonder once again at the sight of the various mechanisms of the room. It was like a new experience each time.

The platform wasn&#39;t unwelcome, as Sinclair was more than happy to avoid the strain of climbing to the top once more.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia stepped upon the platform, taking Sinclair’s hand along the way and holding it tightly. 

“I don’t remember this,” she whispered to herself. 

The platform shifted out of the floor and floated up the tree — Celia knelt down, closing her eyes so she didn’t look down. It was ironic now, given she <em>lived</em> in the room with the giant tree. Perhaps it was merely the lack of control that made the height scary. 

Then, the platform stopped. Celia’s eyes opened. 

“…That was easy.”

She stepped across the gap to the upper floor’s landing, soon falling and landing on her hands and knees from a tiny slip-up. 

Normally, Celia would just get up without complaint. But this time, she let out a soft chuckle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She took just enough care to clean up the wound before wrapping it. Now it’s <em>actually</em> fine. 

“….There. All good now, don’t worry.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair shuddered. He had seen small wounds like that get infected in the past, and they were not pretty. Even in his town of Calw, he had seen a few people that had to amputate and replace entire limbs with prosthetics due to a single medical mishap. 

Sinclair was glad though, to see her wound properly taken care of.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And, much like now, she’d usually laugh it off. Someone older would admonish her carelessness, and he’d bandage her wounds — only to then release her to continue her grand adventures, as if the mishap didn’t happen.

That was one of the few memories she still had. 

Celia made her way over to Sinclair, taking his hand. “No, not overbearing. It’s… nice.” 

She said it with a smile, squeezing Sinclair’s hand.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, September 20, 2023 10:31 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It felt stupid to blush every time they touched, but Sinclair couldn’t help it. It felt so warm each time, that he could never tire of the feeling.

At least when the sun went down, she could change things up. Play the piano, read a new book, aimlessly wander the kitchen, chat with a coworker… even hold hands with them in the vastness of her room, having just linked hearts.

She leaned in again to apply a better, <em>proper</em> kiss on the cheek. Likely just to make up for the last time, or to get Sinclair fired up again.

As he ran his fingers through her hair, Celia’s face lit up and her cheeks became red. Her hair was soft, fluffy, cared for greatly.

She lead him to the edge of the upper floor, seeing the platform that lead them up still there. She carefully stepped on - then made sure Sinclair got on as well. 

“All good?” She asked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When it landed, she quickly went up to the piano at the bottom of the tree, picking up her mask and gloves to put on. Once again, concealing her face.

Part of Celia wanted to ask about why her room ended up this way. She couldn’t ask Iris, who’d refer to Faust — and Faust would only babble about how it was ‘the fathoms of her EGO,’ or that it was ‘a physical form of her mental state.’ Not really enough answers, but the beauty and vastness of it seemed to suggest Celia was filling a lot of her mind with emptiness and fantasy. 

Celia quietly walked to the door, holding the handle and waiting. For this moment, her silence resumed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia took Sinclair&#39;s hand and lead him to the kitchen. The double doors slid open to show that ... someone was already in there.

Humming resonated through the room, and beneath the orange light was Rodya, who seemed to be quite occupied with whatever she was cooking. A small notebook was on the counter next to her, with varying scribbles in overly-neat blue writing. She read the book, then tried following the instructions.

The younger sinner knocked on the wall. This alerted Rodya, who turned around fast as if she were getting caught doing something she wasn&#39;t supposed to.

&quot;...oh! Kiddos, I... didn&#39;t think you&#39;d still be up this late.&quot;

Celia shrugged. Her hand waved over her stomach.

&quot;You&#39;re hungry, too? Mmm~&quot; Rodya put her ladle to her lip, stealthily tasting the contents. &quot;I think I&#39;ll make just enough food for you too, but <em>please</em> don&#39;t snitch to the others about this. I don&#39;t wanna be put on kitchen duty.&quot;

A thumbs up was only given in response.

&quot;Good. I can always count on you, Celi! your quietness has perks, fufu~ 
...
Trouble sleeping, though? Or have you two been staying up chatting all night?&quot; She teased.

Celia kept quiet. Not that she wished to speak, either way. She felt it was easier to let Rodya make her own conclusions, and perform her almost motherly role on her own script.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia stifled a small chuckle. She quietly let go of Sinclair&#39;s hand, sitting at one of the chairs right in front of the row of cooking stations. 

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;This? Ahhh~ Just some kind of stew that Sault wrote the recipe down for. It&#39;s awfully cold in my room, so this warms me right up. Maybe take some for your plants, they&#39;ll like it.&quot;

&quot;Would you like some of this, Clair?&quot; Rodya asked. &quot;It&#39;s real good, I promise~&quot;

Celia raised her hand. Rodya nodded back, preparing to plate the stew after a few more taste tests.

&quot;Most people aren&#39;t up right now -- I think I saw Heath and Ish storm off to their rooms right as I left mine, so feel free to lift the mask a little, Celi -- unless <em>he</em> hasn&#39;t seen your face.&quot;

&quot;Mm. Okay...&quot;

She wasn&#39;t gonna admit that minutes before, they were close and both exposing themselves, but she just agreed with the notions. It was infinitely easier to just let the woman ramble. 

&quot;Are you doing okay, though, Clair? I know Faust tends to get shaken up by her Inquisitor ID, I always see Iris have to comfort her before getting those three-hours-of-sleep. If you need anything, I got you--&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll be okay. He&#39;s strong.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right! He is!~&quot; Rodya parroted back with a joyful giggle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair felt a little bashful to be receiving these compliments. Strong isn&#39;t exactly a word that comes to mind when he pictures himself, but if they say it, he&#39;s willing to believe it.

Faust&#39;s N-Corp ID wasn&#39;t something Sinclair liked thinking about.

The first time he saw it... he couldn&#39;t help himself. For every ID that was related to Nagel Und Hammer, it was almost a rite of passage to be chopped down by a frenzied Sinclair. 

While now he had gotten better at controlling himself, those wearing Inquisitor ID&#39;s were most likely to be targeted when he corroded. Not like he had control over that...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was like watching mother and child, their similarities rang a lot deeper than either Rodya or Celia would like to admit. 

Celia played with her sleeves and kicked her feet against the stool she sat on, eyes scanning all of the items in the kitchen.
The kitchen duty board, laden with notes and half-assed scribbles of sinners trying to dodge their responsibility. 

Another board for shopping lists, including <em>someone&#39;s</em> endless requests for strawberry shortcake and another&#39;s for quality beef (<em>for steaks! *they&#39;d remark). Things they couldn&#39;t afford quite yet, despite the new makeshift accountant&#39;s excellent budgeting and occasional fund increase thanks to lady luck blessing a chronic gambler.

A few sticky notes on the corkboard parallel to the viewing window, mostly being chatter between the sinners. One of them stood out, being a &quot;PLEASE stop taking my breakfast!&quot; from a distressed Ishmael, to which a reply from Heathcliff was written -- a simple &quot;No thanks.&quot;

As Celia let her mind wander, Rodya began serving the food for them. She ended up having leftovers, so she quickly packaged them and shoved them into a back corner of the fridge -- if someone found them, she would immediately know someone was snooping to find her stuff. 

&quot;Okay, kiddos, eat up,&quot; Rodya said while carrying two small bowls. She placed the first in front of Celia, offering the second to Sinclair.

&quot;Mm, thank you.&quot;

Celia split her mask again momentarily to eat -- Rodya&#39;s expression changed to one of surprise. *Is she gonna question me? I hope not... I can just say it was a mistake,</em> Celia thought to herself. <em>It sort of was, at least the first time.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;?&quot;
&quot;He won&#39;t look, I think.&quot;
&quot;Okay, if you say so.&quot;

Celia sighed, lifting the spoon and quickly lifting the bottom part of her mask to eat. Rodya ate from the other side of the counter, keeping the half-tattered apron above her uniform. It wasn&#39;t clear where they got it from, but now it was a valuable asset to Limbus Company.

Rodya kept her focus mostly on her meal, even going out of her way to find some of the buns she had just purchased to dip in the soup. Right as she turned around, though, heavy footsteps walked past the door. Celia looked back as well.

&quot;Celi, hide the b--&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re gone. I think I saw a red hat.&quot;
&quot;That fly...&quot; Rodya grumbled with a half-chuckle.
&quot;Mm. Wandering...&quot;
&quot;Ah, it&#39;s fine. Even if he knew we were in here, he <em>hates</em> this stuff. Can&#39;t get him to try it even once.&quot;
&quot;...how do you know?&quot;
&quot;Just do,&quot; Rodya fibbed. 

Celia chuckled to herself. <em>Seems Rodya&#39;s got some secrets of her own... maybe that&#39;s why she&#39;s not as attentive.</em> Subtly eating, she made sure to occasionally peek over at Sinclair, hiding the butterflies in her stomach.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Okay, kiddos, i&#39;ll handle the dishes. And...&quot;

Celia peeked up. Her head tilted.

&quot;Geez, don&#39;t look at me like that. I was just going to say to have a good night~ I heard from Dante that we&#39;re stopping at a Terminal tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;Terminal?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. They have a few that move to different districts, and one just relocated near where we are now. It&#39;s a good chance to stop and shop~ I can give you allowance!&quot;

The younger sinner grimaced at the notion of an &#39;allowance,&#39; like she was a child. But, she had to keep up her role. 

&quot;I think I have enough... but more would be nice.&quot;
&quot;Get a treat with it. I won big recently, but Fau went on about needing to save it and put it in for everyone, so i&#39;m trying to pretend I&#39;m running a charity service, huhu~&quot;

Celia hummed in thought. What would <em>she</em> buy? In looking at the terminal guide pamphlets, she always remembered wanting to go to the book store, or simply cruise the various restaurants and stores that were at each different one. 

She might have to ask around for the pamphlet for the terminal they’ll be going to, and develop a plan as she read through. Maybe she could get to look around with Sinclair. Celia’s stomach began to churn in anticipation… she was quite the simple girl, after all.

“Heathcliff?”
“Mhm. Don’t ask, just do it.”
“Got it. Goodnight.”
“Good night, Celi and Clair~”

And with that, Rodya’s out. The rest of the bus was still, so Celia stood up and slinked up to the fridge. She opened it, grabbing a small piece of cake that was wrapped in adorably pink plastic. 

She’s definitely stealing someone’s snack. A little bit of mischief - guess it never hurts. She had an alibi, either way. Perhaps it was the setup to an argument.

She took off her mask and placed it to the side, unwrapping the cake to take a bite out of it.

“…mgh… That wasshh… hardurr… than i fhought…—“

She swallowed the small bite of cake.

“It would be… excuse me.” 

The small lack of manners went by with a brief apology and Celia’s cheeks getting red. Perhaps she was releasing the pent up anxiety from that interaction.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair chuckled nervously.

&quot;I-If it&#39;s all the same to you then... I have some things I want to arrange in my room... so I&#39;ll be staying there tonight...&quot;

She continued eating the cake, then discarded the trash in the nearby bin. <em>Should I face the consequences… Ah, It’s worth it. I might ask her for her tastes.</em> 

<em>Oh… wait… I need to ask for something.</em> 

Celia sighed to herself - admittedly, she did want to stay a little longer, but they were getting the habit of staying up late. <em>Is this a goodnight, then?</em>

Lifting herself off of the fridge’s door, she walked over to Sinclair and nearly threw herself into a hug. It was tight, sincere… full of affection. 

How sweet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she separated from the hug, she was left only with the lingering warm feelings from it. Ignoring the sense of emptiness, she rubbed the top of her head with a smile.

She grabbed her mask and soon left the kitchen, but stayed behind for a bit to make sure Sinclair got into his room safe. She had an extra mission, just before settling in for the night.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Glasses... I hope she doesn&#39;t laugh...</em>

Sinclair didn&#39;t wear them often, as they would more than likely get in the way in a fight. 

It&#39;s not like his eyesight was terrible either, but it relieved some of the strain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Knock, knock.</em>

<em>”…At this hour? I hope it’s something important…”</em>
“”…Worry not, Faust believes it has to be.”*

When the door opened, Celia looked up expectantly. Before her was Iris, someone who Celia looked up to greatly. 

“Advice, please.”
“Mm. Come in.”

As Celia entered the vast white space, she noticed a few of the swords that normally hung from the ceiling impaling the ground, forming red spots near their landing. She felt guilty for intruding, just for a moment. 

“Lady Faust, it’s Celia. You don’t mind if she stays for a bit, right?”
“Faust permits this.”

Celia bowed politely. “… We’re going to a terminal, right?”
“Mhm. Why, are you nervous about an outing?”

Celia shook her head. Their next interactions fell silent, as if Iris was reading Celia’s mind and vice versa. 

“…Oh, I see… Well, just follow what you think is best. If all else fails, why not ask?”
“…”
“…not that simple, I see. Okay, next best bet is something personal to you.”
“…”
“Mmm, okay. My, Celia, you’re even making me confused.”

Iris’ halo spun and flickered in thought, before it lit up right as her brows raised.

“Depending on who it is, it’s either gonna be something that reminds them of their past, or…”
“…?!”
“Not that… okay. Just… maybe figure out what they liked, and find something like that. I can’t give good advice if I don’t know who it is, and…”
“…!”
“…You’re not gonna tell me. But that’s a good sign.”

Celia considered this to be good enough, and gave another bow to Iris and Faust before leaving the room. She ran back to hers, invigorated by the ideas she received. <em>I got this,</em> Celia thought to herself before closing the door.

“…Did you know about that, Iris?”
“No, I didn’t. I’m glad she’s making friends, though. Even if i’m unsure who they are.”
“We shall see in time. After all,”
“Faust knows all outcomes. Agreed.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not being frivolous whenever they reached rest stops paid off, as Sinclair had a decent stash of Ahn saved up. As long as everything was not upcharged beyond reason, he&#39;ll likely be able to buy a few books and take Celia somewhere nice to eat. That was the plan, at least.

Sinclair wished he had a bed. Unfortunately, the only furniture in his room, besides the side rooms that seemed to manifest when he needed a change of clothes or a shower, was the chair. It didn&#39;t even move, it&#39;s like it was fused into the ground.

And so, he sat down and closed his eyes, sleeping as comfortably as he could in the split of his room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She left them laid on top of the piano, and shed her mask, taking in the air.

<em>It&#39;s still so bright...</em>

The gem hadn&#39;t stopped glowing. The room seemed to still be filled with that beautiful sunlight, the lily pads on the shallow water blooming with lotuses. Celia&#39;s heart was fleeting with such joy -- it was rare, and so pleasant.

She stepped on the platform and kneeled down. As if on command, it turned and lifted her up the tree once more. 

&quot;Convenient,&quot; she murmured to herself.

Celia walked to her room, staring past the waterfall. In the distance, she could see a shadow. Tall, lanky, and familiar.

<em>is that....</em>

<em>You&#39;re back? What, to wish me well and remind me?</em>

<em>Remind you... of what? No, it can&#39;t be this.</em>

<em>I don&#39;t want to see it again.</em>

She blinked and the figure was gone. Celia sighed. She had a big day tomorrow, and needed to get as much rest as possible. Turning to the small cat plush she always kept on her bed, she hugged it tight as she crawled in and tried her hardest to sleep.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A soft, plush bed smack dab in the center of his room. 

...

And when he opened his eyes...

Nothing. 

He let out a groan.

And for once, this dream wasn&#39;t unpleasant. She was floating in the clouds, sitting on the moon and watching the carnage below. She was with... someone special. Although she never looked their way, the feeling she got when their hands got close enough left Celia feeling at peace. 

And just before she could leap off the moon into the sea of despair below, Celia woke up in a cold sweat.

<em>Was it... early enough to get up?</em>

In front of her was a mirror, showing her childhood self. When she looked at it, she grabbed the doll as quickly as possible. <em>Mirai, it&#39;s too early, isn&#39;t it?</em>

This time, the doll didn&#39;t answer.

<em>...It has to be, I&#39;ll just go back to sleep.</em>

Celia buried her face in the sheets, once again tying to sleep. Her stomach churned, but eventually the sheer heaviness of her eyes lead her back into a new dream.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Do I …?</em> 

Swallowing the discomfort, Celia tried her best to keep her mind steady. Shoving uncomfortable feelings into the depths of her mind — much like the vastness of this castle — felt easier.

The routine was easy. Stretch, rub the eyes, float down the tree, and prepare. Right as she landed at the bottom of the tree, she heard a knock on her door. Covering her face with her hair, she guessed who was knocking.

<em>It’s Iris.</em>

And correct she was, as her dear seonbae was at the door - finally not seen with Faust - holding <em>Chevalier</em> next to her. Instead of her uniform, she wore a simple blouse with a blue bow, and a long navy skirt. Celia nodded a ‘good morning.’

“Morning, I’m just making sure you’re awake. Do you need my help at all?”
“…”
“Alright. Dress like you’re not at work, Verg told us it’d be fine considering we’re not intending to do much than to stay at the Terminal while  Mephistopheles gets a check-up.”
“…!”
“Mm. I’ll see you.”

And with that, Celia closed the door, fixed her hair, and walked to where she left everything out to get ready for the day.

He fixed his hair, found his clothes, and gathered his Ahn.

Hopefully, whatever planning he did would be enough to have the day run smoothly.

<em>Ah, he’ll like it either way. It’s Sinclair, he… loves me.</em> She reassured herself and quietly changed, soon walking into the library to make sure everything was right. 

<em>Something’s missing…</em>

She remembered a small headband she received as a gift during her first days working for Limbus Company. Perhaps as a ‘congrats for waking up,’ or just for landing a job despite her injuries and amnesia. It was a small white headband fashioned like a flower crown - Celia put it in her hair, then put on the mask right after. 

Grabbing <em>Recital</em> and her wallet right after, she quietly walked to her seat on the bus, giving a brief glance to Sinclair.

Thankfully, she wasn’t one of the last ones.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She crossed her legs, watching as the last few people filed in. As expected, the people nearest to her were last. 

“What an <em>adorable</em> get-up, Celia,” Sei complimented kindly. For once, her words weren’t laden with a disdainful venom. 
“Thanks,” she replied softly.
Ishmael gave a passing glance and a nod, making her way past Meursault and bundling her hair in her arms. 

As Holden passed, he tapped Celia’s shoulder. Pretending he didn’t, when she glared at him all he did was chuckle and wink back at her. <em>How annoying…..</em> 

Rodya was the last. She looked to multiple people, but her gaze fixated on Sinclair for a bit longer. <em>Cute glasses!</em> she thought, before making her way to her seat. 

Celia’s stomach churned. 

“Can we go already? I’m starting to get tired of this bus again,” complained Sei while side-eyeing Heathcliff.
“Quiet, Princess, we just got here,” Holden barked back.
“…How long will it be?” Celia asked.
Iris replied, “About an hour.”

She listened to a debate today. A debate about how deep a pan had to be before it became a pot. Celia couldn’t really figure out her stance, but listening to the passion of her coworkers was enough to pass the hour by.

Holden was particularly passionate. Every word Heathcliff tried to get in, Ishmael and Sei would snuff it out and bring up their “totally correct” points. Faust tried to be factual before being mocked into quietness, and Hong Lu tried feigning indifference. Even Iris had a few good points, but she couldn’t defend them well enough as soon as Holden tried to cut in with a “Nuh-uh!” Ryoshu seemed to just want to listen in as well, occasionally glancing at Celia to see how she was reacting.

Eventually, with no side ever agreeing, the bus came to the terminal. It was half-worn down, half newly renovated. Faust was giving a lengthy explanation on the one they were pulling into, but no one cared to listen — not like they wouldn’t figure it all out in a few minutes, either way. 

Right as the bus stopped, Vergilius ordered the sinners off. Celia stayed behind as those before her got up and left first. 

Celia stood up, taking <em>Recital,</em> then quietly walked off the bus. <em>That was… eventful.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, September 21, 2023 11:22 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“…Alright, you all are dismissed. We’ll call for you when it’s time. Any of you who brought weapons, put them on the wall over there.” 

As instructed, Celia dropped <em>Recital</em> where designated. She saw a few other weapons placed there as well, making her feel relieved it wasn’t just her or Iris bringing weapons. <em>Chevalier, Hearse, 鏡花水月, Walpurgisnacht, 太虛幻境, РАСКО́Л.</em>

Ryoshu seemed unwilling to put her weapon away, but no protest was made. 

Celia returned to her spot.

“Go, handle yourselves,” Vergilius said while waving. Almost instantly, different groups split off and went their own ways. Celia stood there for a few moments, gazing at Rodya, before turning to Sinclair.

She scanned their surroundings quickly, making sure the coast was clear. After confirming no one was nearby, Celia moved her mask slightly to plant a small kiss on Sinclair’s cheek. 

Then, she let go of him and put her mask on before dashing off. There was so much to explore, so many opportunities of books she could buy — history, art, literature, even books about other people. 

Celia’s mission begins.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When he finally felt was able to calm down, he began to browse the shelves.

His first priority was finding a book on the piano. While he didn&#39;t have one to practice with, reading might be able to refresh his memories on when he did play.

However, he found some interest in picking up other books. 

Cooking was one that came to mind. It seemed handy, and as of late he had developed an interest, among other things.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She scanned the titles - <em>I need something subtle,</em> Celia thought. 

She took one, slipping it between two other books. <em>Perfect.</em> She smiled as she walked to other shelves. 

Another book on piano, a novel she remembered Iris recommending, a Color Fixer’s biography. She had about 5 books now, varying in size.

As she passed by other things that weren’t just books anymore, Celia’s face lit up. She grabbed a few more things— notebooks, pencils, pens, etc. 

Then, her eyes were set on a small machine. <em>Put something personal, receive an unforgettable trade,</em> she read the etching on the top of the glass box. 

“…”

Celia thought about what she’d sacrifice. She took the stopwatch in her pocket, placing it into the machine. 

It whirred gently, seemingly crushing the stopwatch in the darkness of its depths. The item that came out… amazed Celia. 

<em>How did it…</em> 

She took it, grabbing some newspaper to wrap it up. 

<em>It’s cute… he’ll love it.</em>

Celia soon made her way over to Sinclair.

“Okay. all done.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The worker, whose face seemed to be obscured with a translucent face shield, laughed at their interaction. Taking the money, Celia could no longer protest. She placed the wrapped item on the counter. 

“Separate this from the main bill, then.” 
“On it.” 

Handing the change back, they then scanned the gift Celia had and took the Ahn she held tightly in her fist. Give a nod, receive a nod. They then placed it in her hands, and she quickly concealed it.

“…Are there…? 

Oh, right. There is.” 

Celia could feel her cheeks getting warm again as she held the bag of books close to her. “Uhm… don’t make fun of me, but there’s a candy store I remember Sei told me about. 

C—could we go there? They also have candles, I wanted to buy one or two of them.”

The request was made with the softest voice, Celia obviously being embarrassed to ask.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Which was a smoother way of saying, <em>I have zero clue besides verbal directions I was given.</em> 

Interlocking their fingers, Celia walked forward and lead the way. Although she didn’t entirely know where she was going, something in her kept giving her clues. 

Following a trail of pink, a smear of cyan, a gray pair of wings and a smoky haze of red. 
Passing an orange blur, storming along a violet cloud. 
Glancing at a pink rose, bathing in a blue halo’s glory. 

Eventually, her almost aimless steps got her to where she needed to go.

“In here!” She said, having another moment of childlike joy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eventually, Celia just blind-picked one. “Mint Tea…? Hm.”

Then, she decided that some candy wouldn’t hurt. ‘Some’ then became ‘a lot,’ and now Celia was paying for two bags of candy for her to possibly share with anyone who asked. She knew she couldn’t eat it all herself.

When she checked out, she avoided making any eye contact. Was it out of shame? Possibly. Not that she’d be judged, but perhaps this was just Celia trying to make up for lost time.

As a young girl, she could vaguely remember seeing couples on the same sides of the booth, sitting next to each other to hold hands. Celia wanted to be the same - but she was also somewhat worried about someone walking in and seeing that, then making questions.

Celia took a menu and scanned it carefully. <em>Soup, sandwiches, bread and pastries. Lots of options...</em>

The subtle jabs at the chatty Rodya and Sei made her let out a quiet laugh, as if poking at their habits was amusing. 

“The rest, well. If they don’t stare at my mask trying to read me, we… don’t interact much. I think it’s good, though. Too many friends makes things hard.

I like Iris, though. She’s introduced me to a lot of you guys. I look up to her.”

The little praise at the knight was met with Celia putting a hand on her cheek. She was understating how much of an inspiration she was, almost being idolized by Celia for her many feats before and during their time with Limbus Company.

However, in Celia realizing she spoke too much, she got quiet again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia looked down at her bags, carefully scanning the items. Candles, books, notebooks, pencils… the gift she bought earlier, still wrapped neatly in the newspaper.

She pondered when she’d give it to him. How nervous she’d be, knowing what it was and what she lost for it. 

<em>Did I really need to….? No, it was worth it.</em> 

When she returned her gaze to Sinclair, Celia seemed to lighten up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Right as she was getting lost in her feelings, the waiter returned with their food. Celia’s salad and water was put in front of her, and Sinclair’s macaroni and juice was in front of him.

They then placed the cookie Celia ordered to her side, gave a polite bow, and walked away.

Sinclair hadn&#39;t realized just how hungry he was feeling until the food finally landed on the table.

His order was a bit childish and simple, but it tasted good at least.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the case she needed to quickly cover up, Celia only took off the bottom half of her mask — it was placed beside her plate so it was just in reach. 

On her face was a small, genuine smile. One of a girl enjoying herself, taking in a precious moment with someone she cared about while ignoring the tragedy of the rest of their lives. 

She ate in a delicate manner, trying to savor the meal. It would be the last case of freshly made salad she’d have for a while, thanks to the limited options in produce Limbus Company could get — although, this pit stop might bring up the quality for a brief period. 

Most of her mind was on Sinclair, though, even if she was actively eating. Celia struggled to keep him out of her mind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia just kept eating, but between bites she occasionally would smile to herself. She thought about what he could take her to, what he thought she’d like. <em>Does Sinclair really think about me that much…?</em> 

The thought of it alone made her want to squirm in excitement. 

She’s clearing through her food fairly quickly. Celia’s used to eating fast, from slim dinnertimes and getting her portions in — or just wanting to get back to her usual activities.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She pushed her clean plate to the side, then picked up the cookie. Celia was a little embarrassed with how much sweet stuff she was eating, but <em>how else will she fully enjoy the sweet feelings going through her mind?</em> 

The cookie was picked up, and delicately split in half. Celia got a small napkin for hers, pushing the other half towards Sinclair.

As he left, she pulled out her own wallet. A lot of money was still leftover, she had scraps from when she first joined — it was perks of growing up rather wealthy, with whatever family was left to support you. For her, it was just a few aunts and uncles by now. 

Quietly, she swapped their money out and left a bit of a larger tip. Celia dipped her head low as if to not get caught, but laid Sinclair’s Ahn right where he was sitting. 

<em>…I hope he doesn’t get mad over this.</em> 

Celia raised a hand to alert the waiter. And just as quick as they put the bill down, they took it right up. She felt an urge to lament their career’s pitfalls, but it wasn’t entirely in her place to.

Celia looked over at Sinclair, then starting to smile naturally. Thoughts in her mind rang about where she wanted to put the photo, how happy she was, and wishing the moment would last forever. 

“…” 

All she could do now, was smile like she never has before.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a brief whirring, before it printed out a photo.

“Here… keep it with you.”

Sinclair handed off the photo to her, and began to stow away the camera.

“I hope we’ll get the chance to do something like this again…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Okay, be really careful when opening this… I found something in the bookstore that offered me a trade, so this is worth a <em>lot.</em>”

Inside the paper was a small, delicately crafted statuette of a precious moment between the two — in Celia’s room, playing the piano together. It was as if it were taken from Celia’s memory itself, put into a smaller form. The tree was accurate, their items on the piano, their nervous and overjoyed expressions. The first moment they really connected, immortalized forever.

“…I don’t know how it did this, but… I think it’s worth the sacrifice, to keep that memory forever.” 

Celia put her hands behind her back, anticipating Sinclair’s reaction.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His voice didn’t carry very far, but that’s alright, he only wanted her to hear it.

“I love you…”

Even if she knew, it was that much sweeter when he said it. 

Celia’s voice was weak, quiet, but she gave a response. “I love you, too.”

Right as she finished, she looked up and saw a blue blur drenched in blood, briefly approaching. It stopped, looked back, and stood for a moment. When Celia’s eyesight cleared… <em>It’s Iris.</em>

<em>Oh no… it’s Iris. I didn’t want this to end yet…</em> 

Iris smiled, turning around and walking away. She knew better than to interrupt such a sweet moment. 

“Ah.. Sinclair.. I think we should get going now.”

She hoped he didn’t notice anything, although his back was turned to what Celia saw.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Part of Celia was also curious about what she saw of Iris. When she was ready, she half-dashed to where she expected the other sinners to be. A couple of them were drenched in blood, mostly those who brought their weapons — it seems those who did, but were unscathed, weren’t there for whatever happened.

<em>Did I … miss something?</em> 

Celia picked up <em>Recital,</em> putting the strap of it over her chest. She looked at Iris, who seemed unbothered by what she saw and the fact she was covered in something’s viscera. She glanced at the girl, gave a nod and a wink, then turned back to Faust. 

Celia looked back briefly to make sure Sinclair was still there.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, September 22, 2023 12:56 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dante seemed to be avoiding any comments, simply keeping their head directed towards Vergilius.

Faust looked back at Celia, then looking to Iris. 

Outis coughed. “Ahem. Quit dawdling and get back on the bus,” she ordered on behalf of Dante. Slowly, everyone filed back on, making their way back to their seats.

He didn’t really have a shelf, and the space that appeared when he needed clothes didn’t have much room besides that, nor did he want to risk anything.

He gently put the bag in the corner of the brighter half of the room, and placed the statuette nearby. 

Sinclair was glad that at the very least, the limited control he had over his room could make a restroom.

Although before he stepped into the shower, he considered what Iris had said, and was somewhat curious as to what it could look like, and being able to wash off at the same time would be nice.

“Sinclair. Come in,” she said, opening the door wider. 

As it was before, Iris’ room was a blank void, filled with different pools of water surrounded by plants of varying cyan and lavender hues. Some swords were dangling from the endless ceiling, swaying in the delicate wind, while others were stabbed into the ground, oozing blood. In the center of the room was a cross and a bed of flowers, likely where Iris rested. 

“The further you walk, the more pools there are. Just be careful not to slip, okay?” She said, smiling down at him. 

Rodion and Ishmael were already bathing in a pool together, seemingly chatting and trying not to start an argument about who started the scuffle and who continued it. Sei appeared to just be sitting alone, basking in the sourceless light of the room. She seemed at peace for once. 

Before he left, though, Iris pulled Sinclair in. She was careful not to get any blood on him. 

“I apologize if this worries you, but I happened to walk in on you and Celia before you both returned… I promise, I won’t tell a soul. Be careful.” 

With that, she gave him a small pat on the shoulder, turning around to make sure no one was drowning or about to start anything. How kind.

Celia chose to stay behind, but took a chance to put away her things and change into more comfortable wear. She sat on the bus and listened to scraps of chatter, mostly consisting of sharing plans and theorizing about what changed with Mephistopheles.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t precisely sure how to approach it, and he was definitely not asking anyone else for guidance, so instead he brought a few extra towels.

He wrapped a towel around his lower half to cover himself, before slipping into the water.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She arranged a few items, then looked towards the other pools. Her hospitality was something often criticized, but she considered it a humble task and part of her duty as a knight... she played that role so well, that even Don Quixote began looking up to her on how to be so noble.

&quot;Sei, are you faring well over there?&quot;
&quot;Just fine. No need for you to worry.... thank you for your kindness, though.&quot;
&quot;Any day, my lady.&quot; 

&quot;Hey! Why don&#39;t I get called &#39;fair lady&#39; or something nice like that!?&quot; Rodya called, clearly wanting to have some playful banter.
Iris was simply smiling to herself. &quot;I pay respects to noblewomen, former or current. If you&#39;d like, though, I can do the same for you.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;d be <em>real</em> nice,&quot; Rodya sighed.

The chatter of the women made the normally still and peaceful room lively. In the distance, towards Sinclair, was Yi Sang. He was simply staring into the water, not needing to bathe, but just examining his reflection. Perhaps he was also enjoying the sights.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eventually, Sei and Rodya left the room, cleaning up and drying themselves off. They joined the front of the bus, where things seemed neat and orderly. Celia and Meursault were reading one of her books, where he was re-formatting some of the information for her so she would easier understand it. 

Gregor was playing cards with Don Quixote, who was trying her hardest to hide the fact she had no idea what she was doing. Others were simply trying to keep to themselves, like Frankenstein being nose-deep in her notebook writing everything she did or saw of note today. Celia occasionally would look over to her and want to ask a question, but her fear of the much-older scientist kept her quiet.

After a few minutes, Sei seemed to disappear into the kitchen. Things continued as normal.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She anticipated that no one else would need to enter, so once Ishmael and Yi Sang left, she&#39;d finally be alone -- and able to talk to Faust again.

Back on the bus, things simply... continued. By now, Rodya joined the card game, staring over Gregor&#39;s shoulder and trying to offer advice despite the fact he was clearly winning. Celia stopped reading, instead staring out the window and replaying the memories of today. <em>I wonder when I&#39;ll be able to do that again...</em>

At least, she did that until a loud crash was heard in the kitchen. The entire bus fell silent -- their heads all turned, until the doors opened widely to an enraged Sei grabbing the empty wrapper of what was once her cake. 

<h2>&quot;One of you.... ate my cake. And if I find out <em>WHO</em> it was...--&quot;</h2>
Three heads shot towards Heathcliff. He was an easy scapegoat, knowing how often he got into squabbles with Sei. Celia was hiding her guilt, remembering the alibi Rodya implanted into her; <em>If anyone asks, blame Heathcliff.</em>

Sei noticed the direction everyone&#39;s heads turned. Heathcliff was now staring back...

All Celia heard as she turned away was Sei climbing over the seat, her sleek black hair flying behind her in a frenzy. A fist was readied, another tried to block it, but she landed the punch either way. 

Suddenly, the tension seemed to burst. Rodya&#39;s shoulders went up in discomfort -- <em>How could such a small thing land such a hit?</em> Holden even looked shocked, holding Meursault&#39;s shoulder and trying to shield him from any impact.

&quot;Oi, woman, why&#39;d you immediately come to me!?&quot;
&quot;I know it was you, what other filthy, <em>brutish</em> pig on this forsaken bus has been UP MY ASS since I got here?&quot;
&quot;Why, you... how--&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it. You could&#39;ve at least <em>asked,</em> you know! Did no one teach you manners in the backstreets?! Geez, did they teach you ANYTHING?&quot;

That seemed to be a bit too close to home for comfort. Heathcliff was already preparing to get out <em>Revenge,</em> Sei gripping the handle of her kodachi to unsheath and split it into two. If someone didn&#39;t act, Dante would have to rewind soon.

Rodya looked to Celia to see if she had anything to do with it. Celia was almost frozen in anxiety, holding her mask tightly to her face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Weapons were being picked up, people were trying to react, all wondering who&#39;d alert someone else. Donqui even gazed at Dante, who was looking from the other side of the viewing window, fearing the worst.

Eventually, Celia couldn&#39;t try and hold it in.

&quot;Sei!&quot; Celia shouted -- it was fairly loud, enough to shock everyone in the room.
&quot;Celia...? What, do you know something?&quot;
&quot;I... ah... I--It was me, I ate the cake.&quot;

Rodya sighed. Gregor furrowed his brow, even Holden looked gobsmacked at Celia&#39;s admittance. Sei seemed to visibly calm down... but just for a moment. Her head lowered, and she dropped her weapon, pushing Heathcliff away from her.

Then, in almost a flash of light, Sei nearly tackled Celia into the ground. She held the younger sinner by the neck, grip getting tighter and tighter.

&quot;A--I&#39;m sorry, I just...--&quot;
&quot;Sei, put her down! I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t mean it, and you know what&#39;s gonna happen if you hurt someone else,&quot; Rodya tried reasoning, already fearing the worst.

In a moment like this, Iris would be the ideal person to de-escalate. But she&#39;s not here, and Celia might die from the sheer amount of pressure being put on her windpipe by someone much smaller than her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As if his body moved on instinct.

Someone he loved dying right in front of him. And the power to stop it.

Before anyone knew it; Sei had become a red smear, and Sinclair stood over the mess clutching Vogel so tightly that any more force and he might split the polearm, looking as if he had gone berserk.

When he realized where he was and what he had done, he dashed back to his room.

<em>Bl&#246;dmann! Even if she died it&#39;s not like she&#39;d be gone forever! All you did was get yourself in hot water with her and Vergilius!</em>

As Sei&#39;s body collapsed, Celia also slumped into a defeated, half-sunken pose. Donqui first got up with Gregor, holding her body up to make sure she didn&#39;t faint. Donqui kept her entire palm on Celia&#39;s face -- she was holding the mask in place, which was slipping off 

Even Heathcliff was concerned, grumbling swears to himself but keeping an eye on Celia. &quot;That blasted wench... needs to keep her mouth shut.... Celia. You alright?&quot;

&quot;...Fine.&quot;
&quot;She&#39;ll be okay, and so will Sei.&quot; Rodya looked back at Dante, who almost seemed terrified to intervene. This new wave of sinners were all much less refined and prone to outbursts. 
&quot;I&#39;ll make sure Sinclair doesn&#39;t get much flack for it, it was a defensive measure. One death is better than three. Celia, bud, just breathe.&quot; Gregor was trying to comfort.

&quot;I&#39;ll clean up the mess,&quot; Meursault stated simply. Frankenstein got up to follow, her expression overcast with a sense of disdain.

Celia struggled to breathe. She was more concerned about Sinclair, but in moments her eyes would close and she&#39;d cease to live until the clock was rewinded. The last words she heard were both Rodya and Heathcliff shouting at Dante to reverse the clock ... and then her eyes opened.

Sei was on the ground, still hunched over and quiet. &quot;Verg will talk to you in the morning, Sei,&quot; Gregor said calmly. Holden even wanted to get a comment in, but he kept to himself and simply left the room. The others had it handled. When Celia got up, she simply waded to Sinclair&#39;s door. No knock, just her body slumping over into a pathetic pile upon herself. 

<em>Heh... I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t mean it either,</em> she thought to herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“P-please, take a seat.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I hope this is fine.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia turned her head, somewhat nuzzling herself into the top of Sinclair’s head. If she weren’t limited by a number of things, she’d almost be trying to crawl into his skin to get closer. 

She sniffled. 

“Mm… as long as you’re okay now, that’s good.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia stared ahead, simply keeping quiet. Moments like these were what she wanted most. Even if they were in a less than desirable situation, she found solace in Sinclair’s presence.

Sinclair would reach to ruffle the top of her head, if not for the fact that she was basically resting hers on top of his.

Celia just kept herself quiet, holding Sinclair’s hand within hers and occasionally moving to push her lips against the top of his head. 

Even if it was killing him, she was simply trying to keep that connection and ground herself.

Sinclair reached out for her hand.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She sighed deeply, letting out a breath held in for a while. 

“Ah, I… forgot something earlier.”

Before she turned to grab her mask from the floor, Celia quickly held Sinclair by the face and closed her eyes, kissing him on the lips.

By no means was it a <em>good</em> kiss, but both of them basically had nothing to go off of. So for a first kiss, it was sweet and quick, possibly something to let linger on the lips for a while.

“Ah— er— for the … the photo. Mm.” 

She turned away with a smile, picking up the mask and putting it on briefly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“…”

She giggled to herself. Three squeezes, once again. 

Although she wanted it to be a bit more special, Celia would’ve stayed up all night if she hadn’t done that. Dwelling over her perfect chance to land a kiss, right after taking a photo to seal the moment. 

Part of her even feared the chance would’ve been missed in the far-off possibility she wouldn’t have been able to be revived from the mishap in the kitchen.

Besides, <em>if we stay alive long enough… this will be a story to tell far in the future.</em>

She considered that enough, but would not make much comment or acknowledgement for a bit while Sinclair stewed in it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

All of the books were stowed away in the library, and the bags of candy shoved into the shelves of the desk in that same room. Celia walked out right after, holding a small lighter for the candle she bought.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When she put it like that, it suddenly made a bit more sense, although he wasn’t entirely convinced most people would find him turning into a red mess at her affection would be considered cute.

Celia kept quiet about the fact she was also simply doing what felt right, based on observations of the other sinners who appeared to have similar relationships — Rodya and Gregor came to mind specifically. 

It was no secret the two were close, every ‘babe’ and ‘darling’ rolled off of Rodya’s tongue nor naturally than her nicknames for every single one of her coworkers, but Celia occasionally witnessed how truly affectionate the woman was.

Part of her felt it was what proper couples do.

The other example, Iris and Faust, wasn’t particularly standard. From Celia’s view, they simply were rarely seen apart, always talking in Iris’ room or standing side by side. <em>Maybe affection is not needed for them,</em> Celia would reason to herself, <em>but I think I need it.</em>

Bringing herself back to the lighter in her hand, she waved it around and smiled. “Fun fact; The tree can’t light on fire.”

Picking up the candle, Celia ignited the lighter and held it up to the wick, watching a pale white flame flicker in the dim light of the room. Placing the candle down, she watched the smoke carefully rise and dissipate into the air. 

Suddenly, Celia was calmed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair gazed intensely at the flame as it danced. 

Sinclair had always had a particular affinity towards fire, in the way that it was something that had existed for so long, but no technology could ever truly replace.

But despite that, it was impermanent, it would consume the fuel that sustains it and eventually burn out.

Sinclair let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding, allowing himself to loosen up a bit.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Such a simple response, with layers of implications. Celia sat in front of the piano, carefully watching the flame. Slowly, she began to almost improvise a melody that accompanied its flickering. 

Few things in life were as natural as flame, music being one of them. Celia found solace in candles because of the scent they bring, forging memories she’d never forget. 

She often finds herself trying to find a specific candle for a specific memory, unaware that the keys to such moments are not so simply acquired.

Nevertheless, she tried, and just like now … Celia sought to find a memory in this candle.

<em>Mint Tea.. I’ve never had this before.</em> 

As she played, Celia’s heel tapped the rhythm that the little candle’s fire danced to. 

She paused.

“…come, sit.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She stopped. Violently repressing that memory, that face, she blinked and stared into the flame.

If he never let her in,

And if everything would be alright.

Would they have been friends? Would they be close like they are now, or just passing school friends, never able to get a single moment together?

Onto the platform, and up to the tree. Since discovering it, many things have become easier. <em>That would’ve made the dream more pleasant to endure…</em>

And still, Celia carried Sinclair to her room. Gently placing him down, she sat beside him and picked a book off of the shelf. 

It was… empty, besides where she left the photo he took. Holding it between her fingers, Celia thought about how things could have gone.

She finally had a nice dream. Nothing ruined it, it was simple and beautiful. 

She was in school again, talking with classmates she’s never seen before. Blurred faces, obscured names, but all the same uniforms. 

A boy in her class caught her eye — meek personality, cute blonde hair, golden eyes, and the talk of the other students.

<em>Hm… what would I have done, if I met him like this?</em> 

She wanted to impress him. Or, at least, make herself seem approachable. She played piano well, much like … someone, which made her a figure of wonder among classmates. 

Even that boy, Sinclair, noticed her in this dream. He wasn’t as skilled, but he admired her talent, and she admired his kindness. 

<em>Maybe we could’ve been friends… had I not…</em>

It wasn’t long before she began spending her lunch times with him, learning about his family and where he came from. Celia knew she had to say something, to let him know what she was thinking.

<em>And in that case, I would have…</em>

Before Celia could say anything to that Sinclair about how she felt, she woke up.

<em>Woken up from a false dream.</em>

She rubbed her eyes, reaching for where Mirai should’ve been — but only Sinclair was there.

Celia was a bit too sleepy still to really react to the fact they were in her bed, holding each other while they slept.

“Ah— right. Yeah, but … I’m a bit worried about the follow-up of last night.” 

Suddenly having those memories flood back was like waking up from a night of drinnking to a hangover. She even started dreading going back to that dull life, enjoying the escapism of her room and the little moments like these. 

“We’ll… be… okay.” 

As she got quieter, her eyes full of light began to seem a little downcast, void and empty. Whether it was her reacting to the influx of emotions, or simply adjusting to the change in environment was unclear. 

Celia quietly left the room, standing at the edge of the canopy while staring at the stone platform ready to carry them down.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair was a bit embarassed, but he took the initiative and gave her quick peck on the cheek.

He hadn&#39;t quite worked up the nerve to go for her lips the way she had.

&quot;I-It&#39;s alright... Sei can&#39;t stay mad forever... probably. And Vergilius will either not care, or just assign us cleaning duty...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She took his hand, stepping on the platform. Although by now she had already closed herself up, a pink tinge was on her cheeks — signaling that perhaps that kiss did wonders, underneath the surface. 

<em>He’s right, she can’t be mad forever. And one of the last things I heard was that Gregor and Rodya would try to have Vergilius spare us.</em> 

When it lowered them back down onto the ground floor, Celia quickly retrieved her mask and Recital, putting both on and adjusting herself just a bit more. 

“If you need to go grab your jacket and clean your weapon, go ahead and do that. I’ll be out soon.”

She inhaled.

“O-Oh, and…

I love you. Don’t forget that, please.”

It seemed by now she was trying to remind him, as if it’d be the last time she would say those words to Sinclair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair gave her a goodbye, before going towards his room.

Vogel would need to be cleaned, although there weren&#39;t many great spots to do so on the bus. 

Thankfully, his room seemed to restore itself to a &quot;base&quot; state, so although the weapon still had blood on it, the slick left behind on the floor was gone.

He retrieved his jacket, and contemplated how to clean the gore off his armament.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Staring at her reflection, she almost lamented how much she had to repress everything. Ignoring the truth has its toll, and the more she saw the self she lost come back when with Sinclair, it became more difficult to push everything back. 

<em>Is he… somehow still out there?</em> 

<em>Waiting for me?</em> 

<em>What am I saying?</em> 

She blinked, shaking her head to clear her mind. Stepping out into the corridor, Celia made her way up to the front of the bus. Instead of the usual livelihood of it… it was near silent. 

Rodya looked on in relief. Gregor refused to make eye contact. Heathcliff even seemed tense, sitting next to a Sei with all visible signs of life drained from her. 

<em>What did Vergilius do…?</em> 

Even Hong Lu was unable to look Sei’s way, when normally the two were joined by the hip. Celia looked towards Vergilius, who seemed to disregard her entirely.

<em>I guess he’s pardoning me this time.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Considering Sei’s near deranged disposition right now, she got a number done to her. Even Ryoshu could tell it was a somewhat mortifying sight — a normally pink, self-important cherry blossom now reduced to a dead branch, eyes devoid of any light. 

<em>I’m sorry….</em> 

“Now,” Vergilius said, looking at Dante, “I’ll excuse the incident last night, for only one reason; I made sure that <em>she</em> will not cause you any further trouble. And in the case she does…”

“Yo. Aren’t you a little too big of a dickhead about this? Strawberry Shortcake’s already stewing in her shame, don’t rub it in.” Holden blurted out, brow furrowed. Receiving a cold glare, he shot a mean mug back. 

Every head in the bus turned to the man, as if knowing he was making a grave mistake. Fortunately…

Vergilius only sighed. “Transgressions from an insect aside, yesterday was stressful. I am trying my hardest to be nice, especially with the <em>new</em> sinners. Keep your weapons to yourselves, and your unsavory judgements from now on… and we’ll ride smoothly.”

No one responded, but the message was well-delivered.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sei, through her colorless seething anger, was glaring directly at Sinclair. She seemed bothered by the fact he was the one who killed her, but the anger would dissipate soon. Sei was one to be known for her erratic mood swings. 

After a while, Iris raised her hand. 

&lt; Yes, O Holy Knight? &gt; Dante responded in a lighthearted manner. 

“Where are we going, what’s our plan?” She asked.

Vergilius stood up again. “Alright, I guess I owe you that after our detour. Given we handled yet-another contract within District 11, that same office signed another contract for us to snuff out some backstreets scraps of their office to prevent further infection. So that is where we’re headed, to one of those hives.”

<em>…Infection? Hives?</em>

“Luckily for you, if you get too close to those things, you won’t be affected for long. Is that enough of an explanation?”

“Thank you very much, sir.” Iris said, putting her hand down. 

“You’re welcome.” 

Celia felt uncertain, but she kept her head up in curiosity. After the last ordeal with that office and their chief operator distorting, she felt there was endless surprises to be had.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair was suddenly grateful for the range his weapon provided, as opposed to Meursault&#39;s or Yi Sang who demanded being up close and personal.

He was tempted to turn to the neighbors in his row and strike up a conversation, but ultimately found himself dissuaded.

“…” <em>Rude.</em> 

“N—not, like, being rude. You vibe how you wanna, I respect it. But if she never talked to me, I’d lose it.”

“What?”

“…”

“Okay, fine. Be that way.” He scoffed, folding his arms and turning to the window. Celia seemed to like this response. She looked towards Sinclair, waving in his general direction to hope Donqui or Yi Sang could think it was for them — an easy cover. 

It worked, as Don Quixote enthusiastically waved back.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rodya and Outis looked out the far window, the former grimacing at the sight.

Standing in front of a building engulfed in what appeared to be inhuman viscera, pulsating and growing with rotting vegetation… was a nearly white blur. A halo much like iris’ was near its head, carefully spinning and flickering.

Dante stood up.

Most others knew what this meant. By now, it’s become clear that Celia needed extra care with ID extraction. Her blank slate of a person meant that she was like raw uranium in terms of looking into mirror worlds, any small detail overlooked and it could mean an unstable Celia.

Their gazes were kept on the window for the most part, but some were lining up to don their mirror world selves in preparation. Iris stayed behind — she was plenty strong enough to not need the help of a mirror, knowing who was out there and what they were dealing with. 

In the back of the bus, Dante lead celia to a dark room. She was already shuddering, walking up the stairs slowly. 

<em>Not again…</em> 

She sat upon the chair. Staring up at the ball of chains, Celia looked back down and stared at Dante.

As the chains moved, different fragments of mirrors showed up. They overlapped themselves, showing too many possibilities. A perfect pianist, someone’s partner, an ignorant little girl. Even a cult member passing out orders, a feather of a fallen wing, or a brave knight with a cerulean blade.

In the chair, Celia’s image aberrated. She was becoming nothing more than a blur, more and more infinite possibilities showing up. A queen, a student, a sailor. 

Instantly, Dante stopped. Looking into the mirror, was a devoted knight for a less-than-noble cause. Covered in roses and looking up to a godly figure…

&lt; This … has to be it. &gt;

Celia’s image formed again, mirroring that image. She rose from the seat, soon following Dante’s steps. She made no sound as they walked down the aisle, holding her thorn in one hand and staring at the ground. 

Iris’ stomach sank. <em>No, that can’t be… why…?</em> 

&lt; It was the best I got. &gt;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she noticed Sinclair feeling uneasy, Iris pulled him in to keep a tight grip on him. Her face was pale. 

Celia paused, turning towards the both of them. She nearly lunged at Iris when seeing her halo, the thorn stopping right as it reached the knight’s head.

Keep. A close eye. On her.” 

Iris’ voice was gruff, uncharacteristic of her normally smooth tone. Dante nodded, taking Rootclimber Celia off of the bus.

Right as they got off, another stepped on. The same white blur standing in front of the decaying and blighted building was actually a woman wearing a black and white uniform. She looked at Iris and gave a nod, standing in front of Vergilius.

“Red.”
“Ivory, what brings you to this bus?”
“…Order of PredawN? Interesting choice of handling it,” the woman commented to herself. 

“Ahem. Vergilius, I want to make this easy, but considering how sloppily your crew handled my <em>boss,</em> I’m worried they’ll be blighted by the time they even get close to the center of it.”
“I don’t associate with these people, Ivory. We are mere coworkers.”
“Oh, and my dear knight is not among them? …I’ll withhold my praise then. You two, come out, I’ll keep the root away from you.”

Turning to Iris and Sinclair, she made a beckoning motion with her hands. 

“Noa, you—“
“Come on, we don’t have time to waste.” 

Iris let go of Sinclair, following the woman off of the bus. Already, sinners were fighting off groups of rotted civilians, coughing and covered in the same butterflies seen in the office days prior.

Celia’s gaze seem fixated on Sinclair, as she idly stabbed away at anything that got too close.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Noa turned her attention back so that Iris could focus.
Then, briefly, the two smiled at eachother. 

“It’s wonderful to see you again, Iris. Even if in this case.”
“…You too. You got a wonderful job with that office, even if it results in… this. Must be nice not being on the bad side of K Corp.’s executive.”
“It is. And <em>you</em> have a colorful bunch of coworkers.”
“Hm. You could say that. Hope you enjoy your blight-infested blisters.”
“Augh… gross. Go kill those things, Iris. If it gets too bad, I’ll help out.”

Iris gave a lighthearted salute. She tapped Sinclair on the shoulder. 

“If you get too close or you get hit by any of the ones that explode—“

As if on cue, a burst was heard and a sickened shout from a Rosespanner Rep came right after. 

“—Dante can easily reverse the damage before it gets too bad. But keep a safe distance, or find some way to cover your airways.”

And with that, Iris was off, dashing right to Faust to help her. She seemed to be the only one with familiarity to these things, dodging their moves with swiftness.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He couldn&#39;t stand by idly, and joined the combat as well. The rending of flesh made a sickly wet noise, but it was oddly stress relieving. 

It felt like the tide of infected was never ending, as Sinners continued to swing unrelentingly. The range advantage of his weapon seemed to be rather beneficial in this regard.

<em>Ugh... this is gross...</em>

He was able to see his compatriots fighting as well, Some seemed to be struggling due to the lack of range provided by their weaponry, while inversely those with guns from their mirror ID&#39;s were rather glad to be able to keep their distance, at least until their ammo ran dry.


Every so often Celia entered his field of view as they fought and the sight of her redoubled his fervor, thankfully keeping the main target on his enemies as opposed to lashing out on his coworkers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia seemed to also have a somewhat easy time keeping her distance, moving fast and keeping her face covered by her blooming mask. Eventually, though, her urges take over her -- and she rushes right at Sinclair. 

She reached her arms out, thorn in hand.

Tackled him to the ground, raising the thorn as if to stab him.

<em><strong>...I don&#39;t need to save him...</strong></em>

<em>I don&#39;t need to harm him, either.</em>

An infected corpse made its way towards them. It crawled pathetically, its stomach expanding and glowing.

<em>No, don&#39;t do this. Put it down, please.</em>

Celia&#39;s mask fell to her side, exposing her blood-covered face. rose petals were stuffed into her mouth, peeking between her teeth as she gave a crazed smile. 

Rodya noticed the scene. She tried to call out, but her calls fell on deaf ears as Celia plunged the thorn down.

<em><strong>...deserves to die.</strong></em>

<em>No, stop!</em>

The body exploded. 

Celia mostly shielded the blast, her armor corroding and rotting into her skin. Her hair, now wild and covered in blood, covered her face.

She punched through the chest of a blighted corpse with gauntlets that almost put Soleil to shame, ignoring the coating of blood and viscera on her normally clean uniform.

&quot;Soon, one of us needs to go in and destroy the heart. I can do it, as I won&#39;t get infected, but you need to cover from the blast.&quot; Noa ordered, looking back at Dante.

&quot;Wish me luck, Iris,&quot; Noa grumbled under her breath.

A few sinners turned around to avoid watching the sight. Celia stared on in interest, lingering near Dante. She still kept quiet, unable to even speak. Noa took off one of her gauntlets as it morphed into a wrecking ball. 

Suddenly, different groups of sinners began to huddle together and find ways to shield themselves from the incoming impact. Hong Lu shielded Sei and Yi Sang with his body, knowing an ampule would save him of the pain. Ishmael tackled Heathcliff down, who dragged Donqui with him. Iris held Faust close, taking Sinclair by the sleeve as she distanced them.

Noa smiled. &quot;Alright, boss, be proud of me.&quot; As she swung the wrecking ball into the building, it seemed to burst into a flurry of butterflies and blood. A shriek sounded from the impact, but ... right after, it was starting to shrink. 

Did they do it...?

Some of the sinners were injured by the impact. Some got the viscera on their bodies, a few who weren&#39;t fast enough to cover severed into two. 

Celia... was fine. She looked towards Sinclair, seeing if he was also okay.

&quot;Our office&#39;s doors are open to you all any day, thanks to these two incidents you&#39;ve helped resolve. However...&quot;

Noa turned around, picking up the wrecking ball to make it her gauntlet again. She saluted towards the sinners standing, leaving in a white blur.

Dante put their hand on their head. &lt; We&#39;re biting off more than we can chew right now, &gt; they complained. A few sinners could silently agree. But they knew that a rewind was now over-due, and getting back onto the bus while Noa likely had another chat with Vergilius and negotiated payment.

Now with everyone standing, they were ushered back to the bus. Some went quickly, others lagged behind. Celia walked slowly, head still hung low.

She blinked the tears away, struggling to do so. She never wanted to hurt Sinclair, but still had the image of him dying underneath her burned into her memory. 

She wished she could repress it. Shove it back, bury the feelings and the fear.

Sinclair threw his gloves off as well, so that he could hold her hands.

He held them tightly. To remind her that she was here. She was with him.

Sinclair gave her a quick kiss on the top of her head, and walked himself back to his room.

It was drab as ever, but the statuette in the side of the room seemed to make it seem just a bit more homely.

Sinclair sat in the chair and sighed of relief, glad that he didn&#39;t make any major errors.

Slowly, Celia grabbed her mask and walked back to her room. She changed into more comfortable clothes, staring back at the trailing of her cloak. 

<em>I almost feel bad that I said no… but I think I need to give him a bit of space.</em> 

In the back of her mind, she was starting to remember everything. As she traveled up the tree, walking to her room, Celia sighed. Looking out at the rain, she climbed over the fence and stepped into the foggy darkness.

It was raining. The cherry blossoms looked gray, rustling in the wind. With every step, there were ripples of light along the water. 

<em>What if I never woke up from that dream?</em>

<em>I know I didn’t want to wake up then, I wanted to…. To die.</em>

<em>But I … don’t want to be awake to this life, either.</em>

Staring up at the gray sky into the rain, Celia’s heart sank. 

She looked into the distance. The same figure stood, silhouette vaguely able to be discerned.

<em>You’re here to mock me again, aren’t you? Why can’t I figure out who you are…? Why are you important?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For the first time in a long time, Sinclair had something he held so dearly.

Something he loved so much he doubted, should he ever desire to have his old life back.

<em>I love her. But...</em>

<em>...</em>

<em>I want her... and I want them... but why can&#39;t I have both?</em>

She walked more in the rain, soon running at the figure. The moment its face began to show, she shut her eyes.

Celia looked at the books she bought. She took one of them, hands trembling as she opened it. 

Something about her past deeply bothered her. Spending half of her life asleep meant a lot of her was lost, but she knows what was in that dream. She remembered each loop, the amount of times she tried to stop it.

And yet, here she is, out of that dream and having lost why she entered it in the first place. 

“…”

But now, in this new, sweeter dream, she didn’t want to wake up again. <em>To stay with Sinclair forever would be fine…</em>

As she opened the door to leave and walk around, she was met with another face.

“…Sei.”

“Good morning. You don’t mind if I look around and we talk, right?”

“….No?”

“Thank you, sincerely.”

Wearing a dozen robes and slowly regaining her usual color and confidence, Sei appeared mellow and relaxed.

“Wait, your robes —“
“And your mask is off, it’s okay. This room is… a marvel,” Sei remarked, traversing the water in long, delicate layers of robes. The noblewoman stepped up to the piano and sat down at it. 

“Hey, are you upset still?”
“…Truthfully, the only reason I was going to have your blood on my hands was because I was already intent to kill. You could just ask me for food instead of stealing, you know.”

Celia blushed in embarrassment. “Right…” she murmured.
“I’ve already forgiven you. But this is about Sinclair, rather… You two are friends, right?”

Celia found it uncomfortable how much she was speaking. She nodded.
Sei leaned in, her pink eyes losing their light in a serious expression.

“The rage in his eyes was a little <em>too</em> potent, you know. I think it was something a little more.”
“…hmm?”
“If you confirm something, I won’t tell a soul. My lips are not as lubricated as Rodya’s.”
Celia shrugged. “Likely just wanting to defend a friend.”

Sei glared, staring into Celia.

“…Is that so? Okay, this talk is over. Let him know he owes me apology, and you both owe me a new cake. Oh, and…”
“?”
“…Put some flowers here. It’s so dreary, with your depressive mood and all. If you’re totally-just-friends, I think a flowery room impresses <em>anyone.</em>”

With unsolicited advice and more unexpected shifts in Sei’s behavior, the princess seemed to leave without much issue. 

Celia hung her head low in embarrassment.

However, everyone was still the same. Making her way up the aisle, Rodion had tapped Celia’s head and handed her breakfast — a small chocolate-chip muffin from the kitchen, still in its cheap and environmentally un-friendly plastic. 

Eating it while no one was looking her way, Celia appreciated the kind gesture. As the rest of the sinners finished their morning routines and got on the bus, her least-favorite neighbor Holden turned around.

She wasn’t in the mood to talk, but with his big, oafish grin, she had no choice but to at least listen. 

“Yo, Cel.”
“…”
“Oh, not talkin’ today? Why, did you lose your little cat toy?”
“…”
“Sorry. That one was kinda mean. Look; me and Heaths. We went snooping around and got some info on people.”
“…!”
“Re<em>laaaaaax,</em> it was just birthdays and boarding district. Something like, where they’re from. You and Iris are from the same district?”
“…” She nodded.
“Niiiice. But where you’re from ain’t it. I learned one important piece of information—“
“…”
“—your birthday’s soon! Crazy, right? You probably don’t even remember your birthday. Well, check it out — it’s in 2 days. Not tomorrow, but tomorrow <em>2.0.</em> the like, plus version of tomorrow, yeah?”
“…” She wanted him to shut up. But the sound of a birthday she never knew existed at all was nice. 
“We should totally do something fun or find some way to celebrate,” Holden said with a smile. Celia gave him a thumbs up.

“Oooh, a Birthday?! <em>Danteeeeeeeee~!</em> Are we gonna do something? It’d be rude not to!” The princess called out, half-standing on her seat to look at the front of the bus.

Hong Lu also lit up. “Oh? Who’s birthday? We could hold a banquet for them, my grandmother would invite all of my cousins when it was my birthday and they’d bring.”

“Ah, in my hometown we often took the birthday kid out for dinner,” Iris added.

Ishmael furrowed her brow. “Birthday…? I forgot those were a thing.”

“It’s gonna be Celia’s — so it’s <em>special,</em>” Holden said while pointing his thumb back at Celia.

Looks like today&#39;s a travel day, and the look Dante gave to the rest of the sinners signaled it.

<em>Okay, things can begin.</em>

People began moving seats, walking around as if it were a casual train -- er, <em>bus</em> ride. 

Holden slapped the back of his seat and rose quickly. &quot;Heath, you and I have a match of checkers to finish.&quot;
&quot;Finish what? You&#39;ve <em>gotta</em> be kidding me, last game you just took all my pieces when I was looking.&quot;
&quot;Nuh-uh, we didn&#39;t finish because your dumb ass started arguing with Strawberry Shortcake again.&quot;

Celia watched him leave to the back of the bus. Others begin to move to their own spots and groupings. She soon got up and waded her way to Rodya -- along the way, as she passed the three in Sinclair&#39;s row, she gave them each a gentle pat on the head. Donqui was ruffled with energy -- Yi Sang simply gave a wave and a nod. 

In the front of the bus, she sort of collapsed in the older sinner&#39;s arms. &quot;Oh! Celi!&quot; Rodya said with surprise, welcoming the girl into an embrace. &quot;You okay? Did the loudness back there scare you or something?&quot;

&quot;...No. Just wanted to say hi.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Where are we headed next? Maybe that will help.”

Iris leaned on the counter, tilting her head towards Sinclair. Her halo glew brighter, spinning at a moderately fast pace. 

“But she, instead of quitting, was inspired by him — aiming to be as great as him someday. She’s fairly close, if what I hear from her room tells anything.

…Truthfully, I didn’t even know that she was his younger sister until the first day I met her working here. It must have run in the family.”

Passing off the small background knowledge of Celia she knew, the knight began writing a few things down.

She flipped the notepad around, with carefully written notes and sketches. In the center of the page was a drawing of a park with a garden, with a gazebo in the center. 

“There’s a park in our town that has <em>the</em> most beautiful sights in the City. Of course, this comes with the cost of how bad the backstreets are, but in that gazebo—“

She pointed to the drawing of the gazebo.

“There’s a piano there, and from my memory, it has lights that almost react to the music. She’ll love it. You take her there, maybe buy her a gift, play the piano for her…

…This relies on you not choking up in the process, though. Which… i’m not sure if that’s fully possible.”

She awkwardly smiled.

“No offense, though.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She put the notepad down, sliding it towards Sinclair.

&quot;By the time you&#39;re back, we&#39;ll likely be ready, and she&#39;ll be all happy and buttered up. Sound good?&quot;

Iris mostly manning the plan meant it was almost fool-proof, but she had to do a lot of convincing on the sidelines. Knowing Sei was also somewhat in on it -- they had a conversation while the initial mess was settling down, in which Iris&#39; lack of denial made Sei realize her hunch was right -- she could probably get on the good side of Dante and let things run as smooth as possible.

... and then get right into leading the cake-making.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She furrowed her brow. As Iris thought, her halo spun slower and nearly flickered with light.

Her tone changed to be more serious. 

“…at least, when conditions allow it.” 

She recalled the incident with Celia’s Rootclimber ID — one that made even Iris uncomfortable.

She took his hand, holding it carefully. &quot;I&#39;m sure the others aren&#39;t even fully aware i&#39;m gone, I hope they&#39;re entertaining themselves... even Sei looked happier, surprisingly.&quot;

Celia lead Sinclair into the library, pushing open the door. A waft of cool air washed over them, carrying the scent of endless old books. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think... I&#39;ve shown you the library before. Here it is -- just a lot of books.&quot;

In the back of the room was a large mural of the tree, fit with a small sun in the center. It obviously wasn&#39;t painted by Celia herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Really? I find it hazy, a little childish... but if you see that beauty, I think I&#39;ll grow to appreciate it more. Some days, though, it&#39;s not as scenic.&quot;

She let go of his hand, moving a cushion next to the large chair in front of the desk in the center. She moved books around, barely cleaning up and trying to make it somewhat easy to navigate.

Celia sat down in the large chair, pulling her knees up to her chest.

&quot;It&#39;s enjoyable to get lost in a book here, before I go to bed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“…I missed you.”

When she realized she said that out loud, she began to backpedal. 

“A—ah, I know it’s only been a night, but — I … I just enjoy being next to you, and that one night was enough to make me long for another hug.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She bit her tongue. Celia wasn’t sure if she wanted to tell him of Sei’s suspicions, but again - part of her felt she’d be doing wrong if she hid again.

“Mmm… Well, some are already figuring it out. Sei entered my room before dawn, she tried prying information out of me, but I didn’t really say anything.”

It was a half-truth. She actually gave just enough information for Sei to discern that Celia was lying.

Sinclair wasn’t quite sure if that was good or bad. It’s no secret that a few Sinners had feelings for each other, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted this to be known.

But it was a happy time, and Sinclair would rather keep spirits high.

“Well, we can cross that bridge when we come to it.”

Sinclair pet the top of Celia’s head.

“So lets quit worrying and enjoy this.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;d rather focus on being with you anyways...&quot;

She looked at him with very gentle, loving eyes. It was like peering into a new side of Celia, one that yearned for connection.

Sei wasn’t the type to do much work herself, often ordering the others around. The effort she went through to make her uniform look the most unique often meant that she was mistaken as the actual manager, while Dante was demoted to scarlet-clad secretary.

Thus, a good hideaway. She found it easy to slip out of view, it was likely few others knew even now the two of them were gone.

Scanning the room, Celia looked At various items. The orb-like lamps, the empty top-shelves, the books on the floor…

“Ah. A stepping stool.

Although, maybe I should just buy one for myself.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair was a bit red as he placed his hands on her sides, just beneath her arms.

“Ah, I got it.”

Picking up her mask and running to the door, Celia prepared herself to answer. 

<em>Iris!</em>

“Hello, lovebirds. Dinner’s ready. I can either bring you two plates, or you can join the… display in the kitchen.”
“Hmm…”
“Is Sinclair at the top? Or the library?”
“Library.”
“Well, make your choice fast.”

“So you’re coming?”
“Yes.”
“Wonderful. If someone asks, you were napping and Sinclair needed alone time.”
“Mhm.”

<em>Iris…knows… and she’s protecting us. How heroic.</em> 

Celia adjusted her mask and prepared herself. Her room wasn’t too far from the kitchen, and the noise was already prevalent. Sinners were serving themselves, moving into the dining area past the viewing window. Those not ready to eat were mingling around the edges. 

Sei and Rodya somehow got their hands on cheap wine, holding glasses and talking about what was likely nonsense. 

Meursault was serving everyone, solemnly portioning as he saw fit. Even if Rodya or Sei complained about their portion, he did not budge from his judgement. 

Heathcliff was leaning on the back wall, grumbling to himself about something. His gaze seemed locked on Ishmael, who was trying to adjust the corkboard of their notes. 

Other sinners were all doing their own things, like playing with food or trying to drink the most water in a set amount of time. 

Celia walked forward to Meursault, hands extended. He nodded, handing her a plate. 

“What is it today?”
“Fettuccine Carbonara. Made by myself, Madame Frankenstein, and Mme. Natsume.”

<em>Natsume, that cat…! She can cook? Ah… maybe so, didn’t someone say she used to work an office job? No one cooks for you in that case….</em> 

Celia nodded, moving to the side while waiting for Sinclair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Last time I went to the kitchen with a weapon...</em>

Sinclair was rather surprised at what was offered at the table. A meal this well crafted was not something commonly offered on the bus, but he was more than eager to sample his portion when the time came.

“Celiaaaaaa!” Sei followed. 

“Ah…”

As she walked over to the two women, Rodya put a hand on Celia’s head. “Now, now, are you excited for your birthday? You must not remember most of your other ones, ah~?”

“Mm-mm.”

Sei gave a pout — it was exaggerated, likely from her intoxication. “Awww… okay, we <em>have</em> to make this one <em>really</em> good.”

As the two tipsy women took turns babying Celia and interrogating her on her birthdays and plans, she turned to look at Sinclair.

“Yes, so so so cute! We have a lot of gifts planned~”

Then to Outis, who stationed herself on a wall next to Frankenstein serving food. Lastly, a glance at Hong Lu, who was chatting with Gregor while pretending he wasn’t concerned about Sei’s tipsy giggling fit across the room. 

Celia found herself a small, secluded corner to settle into and eat at, sitting down and crossing her legs. 

“Mm… It feels crowded here sometimes.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turning to Sinclair, Celia tilted her head as if she were smiling at him. Beneath the mask… was a genuine grin. 

They made it out alive. 

“…There, now we’ve eaten. I think… that settles our needs for now?”

Celia got nervous, wanting to ask if Sinclair wanted to stay longer, but failing to find the right words to use. In turn, she just remained quiet, silently stewing in her shyness beneath her mask.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

One nod, and a subtle tapping of Celia’s fingers down Sinclair’s wrists to hold his hand. She guided him into her room once more, unphased by the familiar scenery and the gentle splashing of her shoes against the shallow water. 

She squeezed Sinclair’s hand, keeping their fingers interlocked. Standing on that same platform, Celia looked down at her feet.

“…ready?”

She was starting to feel more and more tired as she got closer to her room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The process was the same every time. It was slightly nauseating, somewhat awe-inspiring, and all the more convenient. 

Celia’s steps got slower, shallower once the platform stopped. She walked towards her door, pushing the wooden door open, looking out at the rainy, hazy view ahead. 

Celia turned and put Sinclair’s hand to her cheek for a moment. She then let go, making her way to her bed and lazily crawling onto it.

She sighed.

This new ‘home’ wasn’t as fulfilling as the last. No parents making meals, no trophies of awards, no expensive fluorescent lights illuminating a piano that… her brother played.

All it was now was Celia, in Sinclair’s arms, in a fabricated room on a mysteriously working bus. Searching for boughs, her own star, and a way to move forward.

Those thoughts and realizations carried her through her dream. And after that dream, it was onto a boring workday, with the same gossip and arguments and lukewarm meals by sundown. Another night of cuddling, pretending the world around her was okay and that the truth was still unknown and invisible to Celia.

Immediately, her head shot up. Hair was in Celia’s face, and her dark eyes were still very sleepy. 

“Ah… it’s- it’s my birthday, right. Th…”

She hesitated.

“Thank you.”

She didn’t want to admit that she wasn’t quite ready to leave bed, but Celia soon let go of Sinclair and half-rolled away. She made extra effort to prop Mirai up on the bedside table, giving the small plush a pat on the head. 

<em>I wonder why I still keep him around.</em> 

She took her cloak and wrapped it around herself, tugging on the long sleeves to neaten their appearance. 

“I’ll send you on your way, then…” 

She turned back, arms extended towards Sinclair for a hug.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia got herself ready for the day. Putting on her mask, adjusting her hair, redoing her braid, putting on her uniform and making sure it was properly neat. 

<em>You’re ready, now.</em>

Making her way out of her room earlier than normal, Celia slipped through any patch of darkness to make her way to her seat. The first person to notice was Faust, who handed her a small black and white box with a green bow.

“Happy Birthday, this gift is on behalf of Iris,” she said to Celia.

Looking towards the seat where Iris should be, all that was left was <em>Chevalier.</em>

“Faust understands you might be curious to where Iris is. She’s currently speaking with Vergilius, but will return soon. Limbus Company may allot you with some free time to celebrate this <em>special</em> occasion in the evening, as we make our next stop.”

“…Thanks,” Celia whispered. She looked at the box, but chose not to open it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even Don Quixote was excited, holding her lance in her arms and kicking her brightly-colored boots to expend her energy.
“Young Sinclair! Today doth mark a special day for Lady Celia! Art thou excited?!” She asked. 

Yi Sang chimed in, leaning forward just a little. “Such an event arouses energy in even the most stoic of our companions,” he commented while aiming his head towards the front of the bus. Vergilius seemed in higher spirits, and even Outis felt invigorated by the brighter atmosphere.

It was as if everyone forgot about where they were, And why they’re together.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was no secret that of the parts of the bus that sat together, the back was the most energetic and the most volatile in terms of how they treat one another. Even now, they were bickering and laughing loudly at eachother while Celia was quiet in the back, listening intently.

After a few minutes, though, all sound stopped as the doors opened. Iris entered the bus, holding a small box that was soon left by Celia&#39;s side. A few feet behind her was Vergilius, who seemed... in a good mood.

&quot;In 3...2... 1...&quot;

&quot;Okay, sinners. As you all know, today is not going to be a typical day. We&#39;ll be making our stop in District 23 within the next hour.&quot;

Faust picked up the rest. &quot;We&#39;ll be stopping at a terminal while half of you all will be handling the work today. The rest of you will be on assissting in cleaning the bus and gathering fuel.&quot;

As Vergilius spoke, Iris looked towards different sinners while holding up 3 fingers -- W-03 was the terminal they&#39;d be stopping at, which recently relocated.

&quot;You forgot something,&quot; Rodya whined.

&quot;...Right,&quot; Verg groaned, &quot;Happy birthday, Celia.&quot;

Followed by that was a cacophany of &#39;happy birthdays,&#39; ranging from enthusiastic to barely caring. 

Celia bowed slightly as a thanks. <em>I hope... that I don&#39;t have to do too much today.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Right, so what are the groups?” Gregor asked.

“What a wonderful question,” Vergilius replied. He began rattling names off as groups were designated. More efficient sinners got tasked with handling their work — ones like Outis, Sei, Ryōshū, Meursault or Yi Sang were paired. 

The rest, like Holden, Heathcliff, Gregor, etc. Had to help with cleaning the bus. 

A last group was saved, one unnamed by Vergilius. Faust, Iris, Sinclair, Celia, and Ishmael. 

“Those unnamed have something else to do. We’ll reconvene in an hour.”

Iris clenched her fist. <em>It worked.</em> 

Celia perked up when realizing her name wasn’t called, nervous about what could be happening. She looked towards Sinclair to comfort as everyone discussed their jobs, complaining or attempting to trade.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>What more does she even have planned--</em>

In the first box, the one that Faust gave her, was a new pocket watch. Somehow, some way, they knew of her sacrifice. She took it, held it between her fingers, and clutched it tightly. 

As Iris looked back, even Ishmael peeked over her seat to look into the other gift Celia was opening. Inside was a small fountain pen and a notebook, etched with her name and ornate tree imagery.

Faust stepped into the conversation, giving a neutral gaze towards Sinclair. &quot;When we make it to Terminal W-03, there are manners for us to attend to.&quot;

Celia turned her head. <em>W-03...? There&#39;s 3 terminals, constantly moving? Well, we&#39;ve been to 02, and 01 was being repaired after...</em>

&quot;Faust knows you might be curious about the Terminal. Unlike the last one, this one is modeled differently -- It resembles the image of a windmill and a music box, specifically.&quot;

Celia seemed interested suddenly, her head darting between eavesdropping on the conversation ahead and the other sinners moving around to continue trying to negotiate their teams. Friends wanted to be together, foes wanted to be apart, well-adjusted sinners didn&#39;t want to be stuck with slackers.

Ishmael listened in. &quot;So, you&#39;re saying we&#39;re playing mechanic with some windmill terminal?&quot;

Faust&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;Not Quite. Faust considers it to be more... <em>detective work.</em>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Mm,” Celia quietly agreed. 

“A music box, though…” Ishmael continued. “Any reason for that?”

“You might learn that as you dig into its roots, Ishmael.” 

Faust’s answer was dismissive. Celia knew that she meant that there were more secrets than even she knew, and the group would find them out.

Iris decided to keep her weapon with her regardless -- even with such warnings, Faust needed protection at all times.

Celia nodded, standing out of her chair. She bowed to excuse herself into her room and put away her gifts. When she returned, the bus was thrust into a stop, causing the usual case of sinners being flung into one another and the seats. Celia, in the middle of the aisle, immediately dropped to her hands and knees to prevent herself from going too far, landing towards the middle of the bus as things settled, landing right in front of the three seats on the window.

&quot;Hey-- ow!&quot; &quot;Ack-- Blimey, could you have waited another second!?&quot; &quot;Urgh... each time it&#39;s just as painful...&quot; &quot;Uueehh~ Geez, Charon, give us a warning!&quot; 

The calls were all in unison, some swears mixed in. Celia just laughed to herself, hand holding her mask to her face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was not uncommon to get a few bumps and bruises before they even got off the bus, due to the reckless nature of the driver. He narrowly avoided biting off his tongue, and helped any nearby coworkers that were still working their way onto their feet.

Different sinners went to their different positions, separated by Dante. All that was left was the group left unnamed, who all looked at each other. Faust stared on at the others with half-awake eyes, then turned to the rest of the group.

Iris smiled. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go,&quot; she said while exiting her seat and leading a line off the bus. Faust and Ishmael followed -- Celia lingered for a few moments, then followed the rest of the line. As they exited the bus, Celia looked around before her eyes settled on the windmill at the top of the architecture.

&quot;It is...&quot; Celia murmured to herself. She stared up at the windmill, then the caved-in dome of the terminal. Although the building was in partial ruin, it still looked beautiful, like a work of art weathered by time itself. 

Ishmael seemed confused by the sight. It was unlike anything she&#39;d seen, and her prior dismissal of examining the place was now met with curious looks, and an urge to ask questions.

&quot;Feel free to split off into groups and go through the terminal itself. If you are needed to reconvene in one area,&quot; Faust explained, &quot;you will be called promptly. Faust recommends you check the engine room, as the windmill has not been functioning in years.&quot;

Ishmael gravitated towards Iris and Faust -- although no offense was meant to the younger sinners, she was in considerably safer hands with the knight and her liege.

&quot;Mm. Understood,&quot; Celia confirmed. She looked past the foggy windows, attempting to see if there were any signs of the engine or how this entire terminal worked. Her eyes instead caught sight of an ice cream shop&#39;s half-worn sign.

<em>aahhh... this one has an ice cream shop!?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not much on the top floor. It was fairly empty, save for a dangling chandelier and the caved in roof. Rubble piled on the floor, with wooden spikes shooting towards the sky.

“Ah.”

Gears and mechanisms were illuminated by the leaking sunlight, rusted and corroded by what could have only been rain. 

Celia stepped towards the open part of the roof. Looking down, her eyes sparkled. 

“Things like this can exist in the city?”

It was clearly some deliberate damage, by some distortion or abnormality running amok. Where it occurred would always be a mystery, as these terminals often self-rebuilt themselves in new locations at random times.

Celia took Sinclair&#39;s hand, holding it to her chest. Part of it was to keep herself anchored, but feeling his nerves build up ever so slightly -- it was a motion for him as well. On the ground was the garden Iris described and sketched out; the gazebo, made with a similar wood as the terminal itself, but much newer and tended to. 

&quot;This one has... a garden! How beautiful...&quot;

This day was already starting to be one of the best birthdays she&#39;s ever had.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

By now, she&#39;d say something romantic. She&#39;d heard Hong Lu whisper such saccharine words to Sei, but never really listened to the exact phrasing. <em>Now&#39;s a perfect chance to...</em>

&quot;...It&#39;s something I&#39;d like to share with you for a while,&quot; Celia murmured.

Not many listened to Faust&#39;s ramblings, but Celia was one of the few who took in her information. She rattled it off in a way that made more sense than the expositional lectures of the 2nd sinner, but it seemed more like Celia was making sense of it herself rather than trying to pass on the information.

&quot;...Was this... a museum? or some kind of plaza -- I saw on the first floor there were some shops and a door leading to what was once a market... maybe it was a sort of town square?&quot;

&quot;So, this is where it originates. Aahhh...&quot;

In the center of the room was a mural of the entire terminal and what it could have looked like in its prime. Illuminated only by two lights on the floor, each detail showed even the mechanics in the basement of the terminal.

Celia lit up.

&quot;It <em>was</em> a practice room! So, that means... is there something that powers these...?&quot; She whispered, fingers touching the painted gears and axels beneath the terminal.

&quot;...besides, I...&quot; 

She wanted to say she <em>didn&#39;t get a choice</em> in having this career, but it would&#39;ve dampened the mood. Celia just shrugged instead. &quot;I dunno, I kinda like doing this a little more. My brain won&#39;t get me in trouble.&quot;

Her mind went back to getting the power on. Right as she was about to come to a solution, three voices echoed from the top of the room. 

&quot;...missing...&quot;
&quot;Singularity? Are we...&quot;
&quot;No, maybe the basement.&quot;

Celia looked up and held a hand out. It was the rest of their party, all reaching the same roadblock. &quot;Celia,&quot; Ishmael called down, &quot;you beat us here!&quot;

&quot;Mhm. Any ideas?&quot;

All three sinners shook their head. For once, not even Faust was truly certain of an answer. <em>Hmm... this has to be really old, then, for Faust to be stumped too...</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Mhm... to the top floor. It was... a practice room. It&#39;s destroyed now.&quot;

&quot;Sad,&quot; Ishmael sighed.

Celia kept looking at the mural, trying to find an answer. &quot;The basement...&quot;

&quot;The market street outside faced destruction as well.&quot; Faust&#39;s voice carried through the vastness of the engine room. Celia tilted her head. <em>Hmm... is there anything there, then?</em> 
Faust continued speaking. &quot;Iris made repairs to the speakers in the lobby, which dropped... this.&quot;

Faust held the hand of a clock. Celia lifted her arms to try and receive it -- when it was dropped, she barely caught it. <em>Does this go somewhere?</em>

As Sinclair paced, a small golden flicker made itself visible in the cast shadow of the gears above. It was a key, appearing to have been lost or cast aside.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Standing on the small bench, Celia anchored herself on the edge of the piano. She carefully put the hand on the clock, adjusting until it read close enough to the right time — last she remembered, it was just about to be 4 P.M. 

Right as she finished, however, the building shook more — no glaring sounds this time.

Sinclair recomposed himself and clambered back onto his feet.

&quot;You&#39;re worse for wear.&quot;

&quot;Ah, uh, we fixed most of the speakers,&quot; Iris said quietly. &quot;Now that the clock is working, does that mean you....&quot;

&quot;Faust handled the issue with the engine room. After finding the right parts, it is now working -- however, Faust must restate that it is <em>not</em> running.&quot;

<em>Not... running. Hm.</em>

She turned to the piano. &quot;Sinclair... can you try the piano, see if it does something?&quot; Celia asked.

She remembered that when her foot touched the keys, the piano made no sound -- hopefully this time, that wouldn&#39;t be the case.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair tried to recall something from the books he had been reading. He tapped a few of the keys, and was pleasently surprised to hear the music that came from them.

&quot;I-I suppose it... works again?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Another rumbling happened right after Sinclair played. Celia quickly rushed to sit next to him, trying to keep her balance. 

Iris quickly held Faust, pushing her head into the crook of her neck to shield her from anything -- a single lightbulb fell and shattered itself on the ground.

&quot;...&quot; When the commotion stopped again, Celia hummed.

&quot;Maybe that time it was a sign we did something wrong. Sinclair... do you still have that key?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair was beginning to get somewhat annoyed by this ordeal.

&quot;But what should I do with it? Is there another door or something that needs to be opened?&quot;

Sinclair brandished the key, trying to find some sort of clue on its design</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The order was simple, as if it were obvious. Celia&#39;s right hand hovered over the keys of the piano.

&quot;Hmm... it&#39;s like an actual music box, then, but you play the music.&quot;
&quot;Good job stating the obvious, Iris,&quot; Ishmael joked.
&quot;Making it clear to the children, is all.&quot;

Celia looked over, annoyed at being called a child, but kept quiet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It took a bit of checking, but Sinclair managed to find a sort of slot for the key. It was rather anticlimactic though... as nothing seemed to have happened.

&quot;...Am I... missing something?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia slowly played the keys again. The sound seemed to have left just the piano, and whirring sounded beneath them. The station was slowly working again, carrying the soft sound of the keys.

&quot;Ah...we did it.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful job,&quot; Iris praised with a faint smile. She seemed half-asleep by now.

Celia stopped. &quot;...I think we should tell the Manager.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He did not mean it with malicious intent, but Dante&#39;s memory loss made the chances of him understanding what was happening very slim.

Still, Sinclair was not the disagreeing type so he swiftly double backed.

&quot;Limbus Company will be notified of the terminal&#39;s repair shortly. As of now, it can only be presumed that the other sinners will be finished with their work soon, and we can reconvene. So for now...&quot;

A sign that the first true phase of Iris&#39; earlier plan was going to begin.

&quot;... get changed on the bus, and <em>relax.</em>&quot;

That was a word Celia missed. She was curious about what would happen now -- is someone going to lock themselves away, playing music through the station? Would it be the task of one of the musically inclined sinners -- of which there were few -- when they visited this one?

As the rest of their group left, Celia lingered behind. <em>Ahhh... what am I even going to change into now?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia quietly ushered herself to her room. She walked past sinners cleaning or just chatting, even walking past the beginnings of her cake being planned. 

<em>Comfortable clothing…</em> She thought while opening her door. 

Celia’s mind soon combed through her options as she kept her back flat against the now shut door. <em>Hmm.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, October 23, 2023 1:06 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not many clothes were at her disposal, and it’d be too much effort to try and use the mirror to take up an ID’s clothing. 

So, Celia put on her casual wear. That same dress shirt, tied with its usual black bow, cuffs neatly folded back exactly to her wrists. Even her cloak, white and only slightly stained from the months of hard labor and occasional bloodshed, sleeves billowing and hood withdrawn. 

Stepping out into the bus again, Celia glanced towards a few sinners and listened to their conversation. 

“…Chocolate. Everyone loves chocolate.” said Gregor.
“Right, but is Celia <em>everyone?</em> No, she’s special. We have fresh strawberries, why not use those?” Rodya suggested next.
“…That’s Madame Sei’s favorite,” interjected Victor. “Are you all even aware of what Celia likes? It’s caramel.”
“Caramel, schmaramel. Just make something sweet. She’s probably not had it in a while either way,” Holden grumbled with an eyeroll.

Celia laughed to herself. <em>They’re putting in a lot of care…</em> 

Right as she sat down to rest, though, Iris approached and stood nearby with Faust. 

“…Is Sinclair here yet?” She asked quietly. “I have a favor to ask.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a huff, Sinclair pulled the gray turtleneck over his head.

With a quick look over, Sinclair was ready for the day. He slipped the gloves back on, and hid his glasses in his bag before walking out into the hall.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Celia turned back. <em>Is he… in trouble?</em> 

“Hi, um.
Dante was going to allot us with more time to get used to the Terminal before we head out to the next bough, but Faust and I got dragged into kitchen duty, and Sei’s been glaring at us since we got back… I don’t think I can avoid it. 

…

Could you accompany Celia out so she doesn’t get lost?”

Iris gave a half-smile with her alibi. Celia seemed confused, but almost relieved she’d get more alone time with Sinclair.

Suddenly, her stomach was full of butterflies. It was their second &#39;date,&#39; but this one already felt more special than the last. Perhaps it was the fact it was her birthday, or the location being close to her home (even if her mind wasn&#39;t actively aware) that made Celia more shy, and that much happier.

She would willingly ignore that such happiness was bound to end soon. For now, she was being offered to see something, and her only thought was...

Turning away, Celia sheepishly walked the two of them back to Mephistopheles, letting go of his hand subtly so the others wouldn&#39;t notice.

The sight was humorous to see — some sinners were covered in cake flour, others were perfectly clean, a few had noticeable streaks and stains of syrups and fruit on their clothes. Then, right in the center of the aisle, standing on a swivel-chair and dressed in a makeshift chef’s uniform was their leader and bossy princess, Sei. 

“You! Birthday girl!” She shouted, aiming a whisk covered in whipped cream towards Celia. “Your cake is ready~” 

“Ah—thank you!”

“Now, come. You must be starving, come eat and open your gifts.”

Comically, Hong Lu stepped from the crowd and carefully pushed the chair down the aisle so Sei could hold out her hand and receive Celia’s. 

Just before their hands met, Sei gave Sinclair a stern glare — one that did not match her next words.
“And, Thank you for keeping her safe. Your contribution is appreciated.”

Celia tilted her head. That was… oddly nice of the normally snooty woman.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She nodded towards the messier sinners, the worst of which being Heathcliff, who still had clumps of what appeared to be a prototype cake baked into his uniform.

&quot;I think we&#39;re all due for some cleanup after this. But, seriously, good job. Celia looks... happy. More than usual, I assume that was your doing?&quot;

Already, a knife was being waved around as different sinners fought over who&#39;d slice the cake. Lighthearted shouts of &quot;me!&quot; &quot;No, not him!&quot; &quot;Let ME do it!&quot; echoed in groups, before the same swivel chair was pushed ahead. 

&quot;NONE of you! I&#39;ll do it. Give me the knife.&quot;

With no protest, Ryoshu, who currently held the blade, gave it to Sei. Celia, who cowered beneath them, watched anxiously. Sei hopped off the chair, adjusted her apron adorned with the words &#39;kiss the chef,&#39; and carefully cut the cake.

Iris returned to Faust&#39;s side, joining in the chorus of excitement among the sinners. Without even a birthday song for Celia, they were already digging into the mediocre cake -- at least it was untouched by Sei, only directed by her -- and enjoying it.

Rodya served Celia her slice, giving her a pat on the head. &quot;You&#39;re all dolled up~ awwww. Say, have you had alcohol yet?&quot;

Iris stepped in. &quot;Now, Rodya, even if Celia&#39;s an adult, are we sure we want to--&quot;

&quot;Are you sure...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fiiiiine. See? Sinclair said he&#39;s not opposed? And we&#39;ll just let them have a sip.&quot; Rodya grabbed a straw, putting it in the (cheap) wine glass to hand to Celia. &quot;Swirl it, let it sit for a moment, then taste. Got it?&quot;

&quot;Mm.&quot;

Iris seemed uneasy -- but, knowing she was just slightly overprotective, she let it go and put on a shallow smile. She reached for Faust&#39;s hand, as if to tether herself to the other sinner.

Following the instructions, Celia carefully slotted the straw into the mouth hole of her mask. Then, immediately, pushed the cup away and shook her head.

&quot;...ggghhhghghh.&quot;
&quot;Eh? gross? Ahh, she doesn&#39;t have a taste for it yet. Go on, Clair, try!&quot; Rodya said, passing the glass over.
&quot;....you... like that?&quot;
&quot;Oh, I <em>love</em> it. but maybe that&#39;s cause my taste buds aren&#39;t as fresh and strong as yours. Savor that, mmkay?&quot;

The taste was strange. It was obviously not top shelf, and who knows where this bottle had been. But more than the flavor, it was the smell of it. Somewhere in the deepest recesses of his memory, he could remember the scent of alcohol. He was never allowed to drink, but he had been around others when drinks were being handed around. 

Someone opening a bottle with cheer and happiness in the air.  Surrounded by people who didn&#39;t quite know him, but nor did he know them. Buzzing voices of a million different topics that he couldn&#39;t begin to wrap his head around. 

When was this?

Sinclair downed whatever was left in the glass, and had to choke back his urge to cough. It was almost repulsive. Almost.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;d like to correct you, miss. It was actually fairly <em>cheap,</em> you were getting bourgois on a budget.&quot; Sei corrected, taking the glass out of Sinclair&#39;s hand to place in the sink. This time, Heathcliff was pushing her chair around, his face overcast as he passed by.

&quot;Mm... I don&#39;t think I want that ever again.&quot; Celia murmured.
&quot;All good. Now you&#39;ve tried. Go, have cake,&quot; Iris said while grabbing herself a slice. Celia looked down at the plate she had -- it was half empty, as she snuck a bite when no eyes were on her. 

<em>Guh... I suddenly feel so young again.</em>

The sentiment was met as she looked at the others. They were just talking, eating, discussing topics she could barely make out and drinking glasses full of what felt like poison to her. Celia tried to enjoy herself, still, though. She was surrounded by those who cared about her most -- a &#39;family&#39; in a way, even if just coworkers bound by individual contracts.

&quot;mm... thank you.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, October 30, 2023 12:20 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh, right. Celia,&quot; A voice spoke from behind. Celia turned around -- it was Ryoshu, gaze sharp &quot;YGM. Let us know when you&#39;re ready to open. DTLT, though.&quot; *
&quot;Mm? O...kay.... just a little longer.&quot;

Celia had no clue what Ryoshu was on about. She simply kept subtly eating her cake. It was an airy dulce de leche cake -- oddly luxurious for their situation, but with the higher number of chefs among their crew, it wasn&#39;t too out of the question.

She was happy about it, though. Such a sweet cake.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was definitely inebriated at this point, and with the little rational thought his mind could still produce, decided it would be a good time to quit drinking. 

The distance between him and Celia seemed very far away. Truthfully it wasn&#39;t that far, but with how awkward it was to walk currently, it took more time than he liked.

&quot;Y-You... g-gaht mail...&quot;

Sinclair started translating to Celia when he finally got to her.

&quot;Don&#39;t take too l-l... <em>hic</em> long...&quot;

The scent of alcohol on him, and the loss of decorum was enough for one to deduce that Sinclair had gotten drunk. He was a lightweight, but he had no way of knowing that till now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ah, right.&quot;

The knight was glaring at Rodya. The glare was met with a shrug and a wink -- Rodya already knew why Iris was so stern, but she was a bit too tipsy to really care. The taller sinner rubbed Celia&#39;s head.

&quot;Celi, you full now?&quot;
&quot;mm.&quot;
&quot;Yah, well, Iris is looking <em>awfully</em> mad at me.&quot;

Iris sighed. &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re letting s--&quot;
&quot;Letting Sinclair drink? It&#39;s fine! Celia may not have liked it, but look. He&#39;s having fun! and we&#39;re gonna have more funnnn, <em>are you ready to open your gifts Birthday Gal?</em>&quot;

Celia&#39;s head turned to the table towards the kitchen&#39;s viewing window. A small pile of gifts wrapped differently were laid out, of different sizes and colors of wrapping. 

&quot;...Am I?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s your call.&quot;
&quot;Uh.... in a moment.&quot;

A smear of icing was left on the mask, carefully wiped away by Celia&#39;s wrist.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Gift time?&quot; A deep, excitable voice called from the other side of the room. A few other calls of &quot;Gifts? Gifts!&quot; followed -- the behaviorally relaxed sinners (otherwise known as troublemakers) knew it was time for their suspense to be fulfilled.

Celia dipped below the other sinners around her, making her way to the table. Rodya followed, then Gregor and Ishmael. Iris and Faust followed a few steps behind, Iris&#39; halo flickering fervently despite her usual tired expression. 

The rest stayed put, except for Sei being pushed again by her lackey -- this time, it was actually Dante. 

&lt; I can&#39;t believe I have to do this. &gt;
&quot;No. no, dear Manager. I can&#39;t have you complain while being my transport.&quot;
&lt; Sorry. Uhm... your gift? &gt;
&quot;That box over there. I got it.&quot;

Celia was suddenly overwhelmed by the attention on her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From Rodion, a pair of opaque black tights and a ribbon for her hair.
From Victor and outis, a record player. It was unclear how they got it.
From Yi Sang, a small desk lamp fashioned like a sapling.
From Hong Lu, an envelope of ... an uncountable amount of Ahn and a perfume he recalled his grandmother recommending.
From Meursault and Natsume, a cookbook. <em>To refine a skill...</em>
From Ryoshu and Holden, a set of matches and a scented candle shaped like a piano. Seemed to be a purchase from a while ago, given the receipt in the bag.
From Donqui and Gregor, signed copies of some books Celia once mentioned wanting -- signed by her two biggest inspirations, Iris and Noa. 
One last gift from Dante... a small plush, fashioned like a cat -- a friend for Mirai.

Celia put her hands to her face, sniffling. Rodya immediately hugged her as she teared up.

“I am?” Celia asked. She looked over to the larger box left beside the table. “Oh, Sei, did you…”

Sei folded her arms, half-sitting on the edge of the chair she was being pushed around on. Dante seemed panicked by this, their arms holding the edge of said chair while narrowly avoiding Sei’s hair messing with their head.

“Go on. Open it.”

Celia kneeled down and undid the ornate gold ribbon, opening the lid of the box right after. Inside was a small floor chair, a flower-shaped pillow, and a blanket folded underneath it. 

“…It’s for that library. Your little cushion is drab, maybe you’d rather sit on something cuter. Or for any guests you might bring.”

With the implication that Sei wanted to visit more, she waved her hand around dismissively. Celia nodded quietly, then motioned as if he wanted someone else to help carry her things. 

“Ah- uhm. Thank you, can I-“
“Come here.”

Celia awkwardly gave her senior a hug - she passed a glance towards Sinclair in the process. <em>He’s…. Smiling. Is he alright?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Thank you, Manager!” She softly replied. She held the envelope from Hong Lu, staring into its contents. 
“…Could I ask how much Ahn this is?”

“Ohh, enough for you to not worry about expenses for quite a while.”
“He took your age and multiplied it by quite a large number,” Sei commented with a smirk. 

Celia nodded. She tucked the envelope away. The rest of her gifts were carried off, given safe spots, and left for her to sort out on her own time.

<em>Head hurts… sort of? Not really… Celia’s here… I wanted to stop by her room later… for something. She’s… warm and I like her…</em>

“Hi… <em>hic</em> Shelia…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She adjusted a stray hair on his head, her hands returning behind her back. Iris gave a brief eyeroll and a grin.

“The wine Rodya gave him is getting to him. He’ll be okay soon, I think he’s just a lightweight.”
“…Ah. He must have the palette for it.”
“Looks like it. He’s been blubbering and grinning all night.” 

Celia laughed. She nodded, then quickly leaned in to give Sinclair a tight, sentimental hug. “Thanks for taking me out, by the way,” she whispered into his ear.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Iris stifled a giggle. She got a bit closer to Faust, who remained quiet and observant of the situation. 

Celia tilted her head towards Sinclair, as if trying to smile. “And I’ll make sure your birthday’s just as good too.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair gently rubbed the top of Celia’s head, occasionally hiccuping. By now, he was mostly in control of his faculties. Not wholly sober, but standing somewhere on the line of tipsy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They were still around others, she didn’t want him to be too affectionate while most sinners were unaware of truly how close they were. 

But Celia kept up a good image. She nodded, keeping a hand on her mask to carefully hold it in place. By now, it was starting to get late — or rather, she was starting to get tired. 

“Mm, Iris?”
“Hello. What’s happening?”
“Ah, I’m… gonna go. I need to organize my new things.”
“Fair. Goodnight - and Happy Birthday.”
“Mm. Thanks.”

Celia bowed politely and gave Sinclair a pat on the head, silently leaving the room and heading into the hallway. She slipped into her room, staring at the items with a smile.

Iris looked down at Sinclair again. “Okay, little bird- are you sobering up?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sinclair’s giggled a little more, playfully barraging Iris.

She tucked a hand into one of her pockets. “Do you need water, a snack, or anything? There might be some cake left, looks like we made it a bit too sweet — anything you don’t eat is getting immediately funneled into the princess’s mouth.”

Right as she said that, she looked over to Sei, who was once again being pushed by Heathcliff and being lovingly fed a hefty slice of cake by Hong Lu. 

“…looks like it’s already starting.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had already predicted someone would have complained that Sinclair wasn’t around to help. Iris’ good standing with most sinners meant that she was decent leverage for making excuses or getting leeway on things like leisure time or falling behind in combat. 

Celia, in her room, opened up her new notebook. She jotted down everything that happened, sitting by the piano on a sturdy piece of the tree’s wood. 

“…Hmm…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite his doubts he still knocked on the door, but was met with no reply. He turned the knob gently, and walked into her room.
